FUEL MODELS\n\nAs set forth in Section 3.2.1 of the Austin-Travis County Community Wildfire Protection\nPlan, fuel loads and fire behavior within the region are indicated by the following\nvegetation:\n\n1.\n\nSparse, dry-climate grass, or grassland, is dominated by generally short grasses that\nmay be sparse or discontinuous (Scott and Burgan 2005). Pastures are also considered\ngrasslands.\n\n2.\n\nAggrading juniper shrub fuel type is dominated by live oak-juniper and juniper savanna.\nIt is present throughout the county. It includes both Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), predominantly in western Travis County, and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), predominately in eastern Travis County. Juniper scorch and mortality values by size\nclass are nearly identical between these two Juniperus species (Engle and Stritzke\n1995).\n\n3.\n\nClosed juniper woodland has sufficient canopy closure to limit growth of tall grass\n(18 inches or more tall) to less than 50 percent of the ground cover. Juniper, including\nAshe juniper and/or eastern redcedar, and deciduous trees are the dominant vegetation\ntypes.\n\n4.\n\nMixed juniper hardwood forest fuel type is 25-percent juniper, 75-percent deciduous\nclass.\n\nSource: Ord.
