Uses include small lot single-family residential\nuse, single-family residential use with an accessory dwelling unit, townhouse residential\nuse, low-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, neighborhood\nretail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.\n\n(C)\n\nA town center TOD district is located at a major commercial, employment, or civic\ncenter. The average density is approximately 25 to 50 dwelling units for each acre.\nTypical building height is two to eight stories. Uses include townhouse residential\nuse, low- and mid-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use,\nretail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.\n\n(D)\n\nA regional center TOD district is located at the juncture of regional transportation\nlines or at a major commuter or employment center.

Typically, this area includes land that is about 300\nto 500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone has a high level of transit\nintegration, including streetscapes that connect the station platform with the surrounding\nbuildings, and buildings that are oriented toward the station platform and provide\nground floor pedestrian-oriented uses and employment or residential uses in the upper\nfloors. A gateway zone has the highest density and building height in a TOD district.\n\n(C)\n\nA midway zone is the area between a gateway zone and a transition zone, beginning\nat the outer boundary of the gateway zone and ending approximately 1,000 to 1,500\nfeet from the edge of the station platform.

A midway zone has density and building height that are lower than a gateway\nzone but higher than a transition zone.\n\n(D)\n\nA transition zone is the area at the periphery of the TOD district. Development intensity\nis compatible with the existing or anticipated future development adjacent to the\nTOD district.
