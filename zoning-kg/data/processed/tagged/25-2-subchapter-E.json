These recommended citywide design standards shall constitute\nthe best practices of the standards adopted by communities around the nation and shall\nrequire design standards that reflect Austin's unique historic, landscape and architectural\ncharacter…\"\n\nIn order to implement the Council's direction, a specially appointed Task Force met\nover several months to consider research and input from the public, various stakeholder\ngroups, and individuals. The Task Force sought to understand the preferences of Austin\ncitizens and the design regulations of other cities prior to developing a recommendation.\n\nThe Task Force produced, and in May 2005 the City Council adopted, a policy report\nentitled \"Raising the Design Standards in Austin, Texas.\" The Task Force report identified\na number of areas where regulatory improvements are necessary in order to raise the\nbar of development quality in Austin. The general intent was to develop regulations\nthat will foster a built environment of aesthetic and sustainable value, enhance economic\ndevelopment efforts, promote Austin's unique character and natural environment, and\nensure an efficient development review process.\n\nThe proposals for new standards were intended to raise the level of quality for all\nnon-residential and mixed-use development, but within a regulatory structure offering\noptions and flexibility, not strict requirements. New development would be subject\nto a set of minimum site and building design standards, recognizing that all new development,\nregardless of size, should be subject to minimum standards. The following topics were\naddressed in the Task Force report: Development orientation; Parking; Land use; Signs;\nStormwater management; Connectivity; Exterior lighting; Screening and compatibility;\nand Building design.\n\nIn each of these topic areas, the Task Force report discussed the key issue generally\nand proposed regulatory language to address the issue. In a few areas, specific ordinance\nlanguage was proposed, but in most areas the proposed language recommended general\napproaches rather than actual ordinance language. In some areas, the proposed new\nstandards would be new for Austin, while in other areas the proposed standards would\nrequire amendments to the Austin Code.\n\nThis Subchapter is intended to implement the Task Force report by establishing a clear,\nuser-friendly, and legally enforceable ordinance that will result in improved development\nquality in Austin. This Subchapter is officially known as Subchapter E of Chapter 25-2 of the City Code. This Subchapter was adopted on August 31, 2006, and will become\neffective on January 13, 2007. The Task Force recommends reviewing this Subchapter\nonce it has been in place for one year.\n\nHow to use this Subchapter:\n\nApplicability is Based on Adjacent Roadway and Type of Development: This Subchapter\nrecognizes that development should reflect and respond to its location within the\ncity. For example, a commercial development in a suburban location can (and often\nshould) look and function differently than a commercial development in downtown Austin.\nBecause roadways provide both access to a site and define the urban design framework\nof the city, roadway types have been used as an organizing tool to establish many\nof the new development standards in this Subchapter. This approach is intended to\nhelp ensure a cohesive development pattern along Austin's streets and remove some\nof the inconsistency that arises from having a variety of zoning districts fronting\na single roadway.\n\nBecause many of the standards in this Subchapter are defined based on roadway type(s)\nnear the property, an important first step in the development process is to determine\nthe roadway types that are adjacent to a site. The size of the site and the type of\ndevelopment (residential, commercial, mixed use, etc.) also need to be considered,\nsince different standards may apply. The applicability chart in Article 1 summarizes\nthe applicability of all the standards in this Subchapter, based on type of adjacent\nroadways and development activity.\n\nThe following different types of roadways are identified in this Subchapter:\n\nCore Transit Corridors include roadways that have or will have a sufficient population\ndensity, mix of uses, and transit facilities to encourage and support transit use.\nExisting Core Transit Corridors have been designated and are defined in Article 5\nand shown on Figure 1. Examples include South Congress Avenue (north of Stassney Lane)\nand Anderson Lane (between Burnet Road and Mopac). Additional Core Transit Corridors\nmay be designated in the future through neighborhood planning processes.\n\nHill Country Roadways are those roadways identified in Section 25-2-1103, such as RM 2222 and Southwest Parkway. Standards in this Subchapter that reference\nthe Hill County Roadway designation apply to all properties within 1000 feet of these\nroadways.\n\nHighways include all freeways, parkways, expressways, and frontage roads identified\nin the Austin Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan, except for Core Transit Corridors.\n\nInternal Circulation Routes are public streets or private drives edged by a curb within\na development.\n\nSuburban Roadways are roads outside the Urban Roadway Boundary, defined below and\nshown on Figure 2, that are not Core Transit, Hill Country, or Highway Roadways.\n\nUrban Roadways are roads other than those designated as Core Transit Corridors and\nHighways located within the following boundaries, as shown on Figure 2:\n\n183 from Burnet to Hwy 71\n\nHwy 71 from 183 to Loop 1\n\nLoop 1 from Hwy 71 to Lake Austin\n\nLake Austin from Loop 1 to Exposition\n\nExposition from Lake Austin to 35th\n\n35th from Exposition to Loop 1\n\nLoop 1 from 38th to RM 2222\n\nRM 2222 from Loop 1 to Mesa\n\nMesa from RM 2222 to Spicewood Springs Road\n\nSpicewood Springs Road from Mesa to 360\n\n360 from Spicewood Springs Road to Great Hills Trail\n\nGreat Hills Trail from 360 to 183\n\n183 from Great Hills Trail to Braker\n\nBraker from 183 to Burnet\n\nBurnet from Braker to 183\n\n![Figure 1: Core Transit Corridors (CTC) and Future Core Transit Corridors Map (May 10, 2010)](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubchE-Fig1.png)\n\nFigure 1: Core Transit Corridors (CTC) and Future Core Transit Corridors Map (May\n10, 2010)\n\n![Figure 2: Urban/Suburban Roadways Map](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubchE-Fig2.png)\n\nFigure 2: Urban/Suburban Roadways Map\n\nHow this Subchapter is organized:\n\nThis Subchapter is divided into five Articles.\n\nArticle 1 includes General Provisions that should be reviewed for all development\nand redevelopment projects. Most importantly, a chart summarizes the applicability\nof the various standards based on roadway types and development types.\n\nTo allow flexibility in administering this Subchapter, this Article includes a \"minor\nmodification\" provision that allows for City staff to approve small deviations from\notherwise applicable standards in order to protect natural or historic features or\nto address unique site conditions.\n\nThe Article also encourages creativity and innovative design by allowing an applicant\nto propose an alternative approach to meeting the standards of the Subchapter through\nthe \"alternative equivalent compliance\" provision.\n\nArticle 2 includes Site Development Standards intended to ensure that buildings relate\nappropriately to surrounding developments and streets, promote efficient pedestrian\nand vehicle circulation, and provide parking in safe and appropriate locations, while\ncreating a unique and identifiable image for development in Austin. In particular,\nstandards in this Article address the following:\n\nRelationship of buildings to streets and walkways (based on roadway type);\n\nConnectivity (based on roadway type);\n\nExterior lighting;\n\nScreening of equipment and utilities; and\n\nPrivate common open space and pedestrian amenities.\n\nArticle 3 includes Building Design Standards intended to address the physical appearance\nof buildings subject to this Subchapter. Included are:\n\nGeneral requirements for glazing and shading to ensure that building façades are pedestrian-friendly;\nand\n\nAdditional options to improve building design. An applicant may choose which of these\noptions to meet from a flexible, point-based menu. All buildings subject to this section\nmust reach a minimum number of points, with additional points required for certain\nbuilding types (e.g., buildings with trademarked design features, large buildings\nor long façades, and buildings using a large percentage of certain building materials.)\n\nArticle 4 includes standards and incentives for Mixed Use development. This Article\nincludes descriptions and standards for the Mixed Use Combining District and the Vertical\nMixed Use Overlay District. This Article also includes standards and incentives for\nthe development of Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) buildings.\n\nArticle 5 includes Definitions for terms used in this Subchapter.\n\nSource: Ord. No. 20231102-028, Pt. 27, 11-13-23.\n\nThis Subchapter generally addresses the physical relationship between commercial and\nother nonresidential development and adjacent properties, public streets, neighborhoods,\nand the natural environment, in order to implement the City Council's vision for a\nmore attractive, efficient, and livable community. The general purposes of this Subchapter\ninclude:\n\n1.1.1.\n\nTo provide appropriate standards to ensure a high quality appearance for Austin and\npromote pedestrian-friendly design while also allowing flexibility, individuality,\ncreativity, and artistic expression;\n\n1.1.2.\n\nTo strengthen and protect the image, identity, and unique character of Austin and\nthereby to enhance its business economy;\n\n1.1.3.\n\nTo protect and enhance residential neighborhoods, commercial districts, and other\nareas by encouraging physical development that is of high quality and is compatible\nwith the character, scale, and function of its surrounding area;\n\n1.1.4.\n\nTo encourage developments that relate well to adjoining public streets, open spaces,\nand neighborhoods; and\n\n1.1.5.\n\nTo provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible\nmix of residential and nonresidential uses within close proximity to each other, rather\nthan separating uses.\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\n1.2.1.\n  General Applicability.\n\nThe applicability of this Subchapter varies by section and is dependent on the type\nof principal street that the subject lot or site faces and on the type of development\nactivity proposed. Table A summarizes the applicability of each section of this Subchapter.\nOnly those sites and projects that meet both the principal street and development\ntype thresholds in the table are subject to the particular standard. General exemptions\nfrom the requirements of this Subchapter are listed in Subsection 1.2.4., and additional\nexemptions from specific standards are listed in subsequent sections of this Subchapter.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TABLE A.

This Subchapter is\nnot intended to supersede any applicable state or federal accessibility statutes and\nregulations. Administration and enforcement of this Subchapter shall comply with all\nsuch statutes and regulations.\n\nAll pedestrian routes constructed within the public right-of-way shall be constructed\nso as to provide legally accessible transitions to pedestrian routes on adjacent properties.\n\n1.2.7.\n  State and Federal Facilities.\n\nCompliance with the standards of this Subchapter at all state and federal facilities\nis encouraged.\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20071101-052; Ord. 20090312-035; Ord. 20090611-074;\nOrd. 20100408-049; Ord. 20130509-039; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\n1.3.1.\n  Standards Applicable During Site Plan Review.\n\nThe standards contained in the following sections of this Subchapter shall be applied\nin the normal review process for site plans as set forth in Chapter 25-5 of the Austin Code:\n\nA.\n\nSection 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways,\n\nB.\n\nSection 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites,\n\nC.\n\nSection 2.4, Building Entryways,\n\nD.\n\nSection 2.5, Exterior Lighting,\n\nE.\n\nSection 2.6, Screening of Equipment and Utilities,\n\nF.\n\nSection 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities,\n\nG.\n\nShade and Shelter, and\n\nH.\n\nArticle 4, Mixed Use.\n\nIn addition to meeting the review criteria specified in Chapter 25-5, each site plan application shall evidence compliance with the standards listed above.\n\n1.3.2.\n  Standards Applicable During Building Permit Review.\n\nThe standards contained in the following sections of this Subchapter shall be applied\nin the normal review process for building permits as set forth in Chapter 25-11 of the Land Development Code:\n\nA.\n\nSection 2.5, Exterior Lighting,\n\nB.\n\nSection 2.6, Screening of Equipment and Utilities, and\n\nC.\n\nArticle 3, Building Design Standards.\n\nIn addition to meeting the review criteria specified in Chapter 25-11, each building permit application shall evidence compliance with the standards listed\nabove.\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\n1.4.1.\n  Purpose and Scope.\n\n\"Minor modifications\" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of\nthis Subchapter that may be approved by the Director in order to protect natural or\nhistoric features or to address unusual site conditions. Minor modifications are to\nbe used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood\nof any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary\nto complete a formal variance process.\n\n1.4.2.\n  Applicability.\n\nThe Director may approve minor modifications of any numeric development standard in\nthis Subchapter up to a maximum of ten percent (or up to a maximum of 20 percent to\nprotect an existing natural site feature), provided that the applicable criteria in\nSection 1.4.4 (Approval Criteria) are met.\n\nFor a Heritage Tree, the Director may approve modification of any numeric development\nstandard in this Subchapter to the minimum extent required to preserve the Heritage\nTree.\n\nA modified development standard is calculated by applying the percentage of modification\nallowed by the Director to the numeric requirement that would otherwise apply if the\ndevelopment standard was not modified. For example, if a building façade is required\nto have 40% glazing, which would equal 400 square feet glazing on a 1000-square foot\nfaçade, then a 10% minor modification would decrease the amount of required glazing\nby 40 square feet for a total of 360 square feet of required glazing. The minor modification\nprocess may be used only to authorize a less restrictive standard and may not be used\nto impose a standard on the subject property than is higher than otherwise provided\nin this Subchapter. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a minor modification\nthat results in:\n\nA.\n\nAn increase in overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover;\n\nB.\n\nA change in permitted uses or mix of uses;\n\nC.\n\nA change in the requirements of any of the following provisions:\n\n1.\n\nSubchapter C, Article 3 (Additional Requirements for Certain Districts);\n\n2.\n\nSubchapter C, Article 4 (Additional Requirements for Certain Uses);\n\n3.\n\nSubchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards); or\n\nD.\n\nA change in conditions attached to a subdivision plan, site plan, special use permit,\nor restrictive covenant approved by the City.\n\n1.4.3.\n  Procedure.\n\nThe Director may initiate or approve a minor modification allowed under this section\nat any time prior to submittal of the staff report on the application to another decision-making\nbody or prior to final decision if the Director is the final decision-maker. The Director\nshall specify any approved minor modifications and the justifications for such modifications\non the pending development application for which the modifications were sought.\n\n1.4.4.\n  Approval Criteria.\n\nThe Director may approve a minor modification from the terms of this Subchapter only\nupon finding that the modification meets all of the criteria below:\n\nA.\n\nThe requested modification is in general conformity with the stated purposes of this\nSubchapter;\n\nB.\n\nThe requested modification meets all other applicable zoning, building, drainage,\nwater quality, and safety code requirements;\n\nC.\n\nThe requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health,\nsafety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the general public, or\nsuch impacts will be substantially mitigated; and\n\nD.\n\nThe requested modification is necessary to compensate for some practical difficulty\nor some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development not shared by landowners\nin general.\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20100408-049; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\n1.5.1.\n  Purpose and Scope.\n\nTo encourage creative and original design, and to accommodate projects where the particular\nsite conditions or the proposed use prevent strict compliance with this Subchapter,\nalternative equivalent compliance allows development to occur in a manner that meets\nthe intent of this Subchapter, yet through an alternative design that does not strictly\nadhere to the Subchapter's standards. The procedure is not a general waiver of regulations.\nAlternative equivalent compliance shall not be used when the desired departure from\nthe standards of this Subchapter could be achieved using the minor modification process\nin Section 1.4.\n\n1.5.2.\n  Applicability.\n\nThe alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following\nsections of this Subchapter:\n\nA.\n\nSection 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways;\n\nB.\n\nSection 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites;\n\nC.\n\nSection 2.5, Exterior Lighting;\n\nD.\n\nSection 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities;\n\nE.\n\nSection 2.8, Shade and Shelter; and\n\nF.\n\nArticle 3, Building Design Standards.\n\n1.5.3.\n  Procedure.\n\nThe applicant may select at his or her discretion whether to seek an informal recommendation\nor a formal approval on a proposal for alternative compliance.\n\nA.\n\nOption One: Informal Recommendation.\n\n1.\n\nPre-Application Conference Required. If an applicant desires only an informal response and recommendation as to a proposal\nfor alternative compliance, he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference\nprior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.\nAt the conference, the applicant shall provide a written summary of the project and\nthe proposed alternative compliance, and the Director shall offer an informal, non-binding\nresponse and recommendation regarding the appropriateness of the proposed alternative.\nBased on that response, the applicant may prepare a site plan and/or building permit\napplication that proposes alternative compliance, and such application shall include\nsufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the\nalternative compliance requested.\n\n2.\n\nDecision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be\nthe responsibility of the decision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application.\nThe final decision-making body for site plans is either the Director or the appropriate\nLand Use Commission, as specified in Chapter 25-5, and the building official for building permits.\n\n3.\n\nDecision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection\nthe Director shall review the concept plan for compliance with the criteria in Section\n1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\n\nB.\n\nOption Two: Formal Decision.\n\n1.\n\nPre-Application Conference. If an applicant desires formal approval of a proposal for alternative compliance,\nhe or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting\nthe site plan and/or building permit application for the development.\n\n2.\n\nAlternative Compliance Concept Plan Required. At least ten days prior to the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit\nan alternative compliance concept plan application to the Director, which shall include:\n\na.\n\nA written description of and justification for the proposed alternative method of\ncompliance, specifically addressing the criteria in Section 1.5.4.; and\n\nb.\n\nA concept plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, the\nintended locations and quantities of proposed buildings on the site, the layout of\nproposed vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation systems, and areas designated\nto meet requirements for open space, parking, on-site amenities, utilities, and landscape.\nThe concept plan shall describe the site's topography and shall provide a general\ndescription of environmental characteristics to assist in determining compliance with\nthis Subchapter. If alternative compliance is requested from the standards of Article\n3, Building Design, the concept plan also shall include descriptions and illustrations\nof the proposed building design elements that would not comply with the standards\nof this Subchapter.\n\n3.\n\nDecision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection\nthe Director shall review the concept plan for compliance with the criteria in Section\n1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\n\n4.\n\nExpiration of Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\n\na.\n\nAn approved alternative compliance concept plan shall expire if three years pass following\nits approval and no building permit that implements the concept plan has been issued.\n\nb.\n\nOne, one-year extension may be issued by the Director provided that a written request\nhas been received prior to the expiration of the concept plan, and the Director has\ndetermined that no major changes in the city's development standards, or changes in\nthe development pattern of the surrounding properties, have occurred.\n\n5.\n\nEffect of Approval. Written approval of an alternative compliance concept plan does not authorize any\ndevelopment activity, but rather authorizes the applicant to prepare a site plan and/or\nbuilding permit application that incorporates the approved alternative compliance,\nand authorizes the decision-making body (either the Land Use Commission or the Director\nfor site plans, and the building official for building permits) to review the site\nplan and/or building permit application for compliance with the alternative compliance\nconcept plan, in addition to all other applicable requirements. The site plan and/or\nbuilding permit application shall include a copy of the approved alternative compliance\nconcept plan.\n\n6.\n\nAmendments to Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\n\na.\n\nMinor amendments to any approved alternative compliance concept plan may be approved,\napproved with conditions, or denied administratively by the Director. For purposes\nof this provision, minor amendments are those that do not result in:\n\n(i)\n\nAn increase of 10 percent or more in the amount of square footage of a land use or\nstructure;\n\n(ii)\n\nA change in the types of uses in the project;\n\n(iii)\n\nAn increase or decrease of 20 percent or more in the number of dwelling units in the\nproject; or\n\n(iv)\n\nA change that would bring the project out of compliance with any requirement or regulation\nset forth in the City Code outside this Subchapter unless a variance to or waiver\nfrom such requirement or regulation is obtained.\n\nb.\n\nAmendments that are not determined by the Director to be minor amendments under subsection\na. above shall be deemed major amendments. The applicant may seek approval of a major\namendment by re-submitting the original approved plan along with the proposed amendment\nto the Director for review in the same manner prescribed in subsection B.2. above.\n\nc.\n\nIf any site plan and/or building permit application includes a major amendment from\nthe terms of the approved concept plan that has not been approved by the Director,\nthe concept plan shall be void and the application shall be reviewed for compliance\nwith the standards of this Subchapter and all other applicable requirements.\n\n1.5.4.\n  Criteria.\n\nAlternative equivalent compliance may be approved only if the applicant demonstrates\nthat the following criteria have been met:\n\nA.\n\nThe proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter\nfrom which the alternative is sought; or\n\nB.\n\nThe proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter\nfrom which the alternative is sought to the maximum extent practicable and is necessary\nbecause:\n\n1.\n\nPhysical characteristics unique to the subject site (such as, but not limited to,\nslopes, size, shape, and vegetation) make strict compliance with the subject standard\nimpracticable or unreasonable;\n\n2.\n\nPhysical design characteristics unique to the proposed use or type of use make strict\ncompliance with the subject standard impracticable or unreasonable; or\n\n3.\n\nAn undue financial hardship would be created for a development less than 10,000 square\nfeet without any exterior trademark design feature.\n\n1.5.5.\n  Effect of Approval.\n\nAlternative compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested\nand shall not establish a precedent for approval of other requests.\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\nThe adoption date of this Subchapter is August 31, 2006.

In this Subchapter, roadway types are used as an organizing tool for certain development\nstandards. In this Section 2.2., sidewalk, building placement, and streetscape standards\nand building entryway location are determined by the roadway type that is adjacent\nto the site. The following five roadway types are listed from highest to lowest priority\nfor purposes of this Subchapter (See Figures 3 - 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached\nto Ord. 20130606-088):\n\n1.\n\nCore Transit Corridor;\n\n2.\n\nInternal Circulation Route;\n\n3.\n\nUrban Roadway;\n\n4.\n\nSuburban Roadway; and\n\n5.\n\nHighway or Hill Country Roadway.\n\nB.\n\nApplicability. The roadway with the highest level of priority adjacent to the lot or site is considered\nthe \"principal street\" for purposes of this Subchapter. For a lot or site that is\nadjacent to more than one roadway of equal priority, the development shall be subject\nto the standards associated with the roadway with the highest level of transit service,\nas determined by the Director, or if the roadways do not have transit service or the\nlevel of transit service is equal, the roadway designated by the lot owner.\n\nFor large sites subject to Section 2.2.5. or for sites abutting more than one roadway\ntype, the Sidewalk and Supplemental Zone requirements (but not the Building Placement\nand Parking requirements) shall apply along all abutting streets or Internal Circulation\nRoute frontages, with the applicable requirements determined by the roadway type.\n\n2.2.2.\n  Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement.\n\nA.\n\nApplicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:\n\n| Standard | Applies if the Principal Street Is: | Applies to the Following: |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2.2.2. Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement | Core Transit Corridor | - All zoning districts   - Single-family residential uses are exempt, in addition to the general exemptions in Section 1.2.4. |\n\n(See Figure 3 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of a Core Transit Corridor\n(South Congress)\n\n(See Figure 4 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of an Internal Circulation\nRoute (Midtown Commons)\n\n(See Figure 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of Highway (1-35)\n\nB.\n\nSidewalks. In order to create an environment that is supportive of pedestrian and transit mobility,\npublic sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all Core Transit Corridors in\naccordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is\nrequired for all sites with frontage along a Core Transit Corridor regardless of principal\nstreet designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on\none side of a street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite\nside of the street or right-of-way. A development that complies with the Great Streets\nstandards adopted by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt\nfrom the requirements of this section and may seek any reimbursements available under\nthe Great Streets Development program.\n\nFor development that is subject to the requirements of this section, no sidewalk shall\nbe less than 15 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part of the Alternative\nEquivalent Compliance process. The 15-foot minimum requirement shall apply regardless\nof the available right-of-way. Where required, the sidewalk shall extend onto private\nproperty to fulfill the 15-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk easement provided.\n\nSidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb,\nand a clear zone. (See Figures 6 - 9.) The following standards shall apply to these\nzones:\n\n(See Figure 6 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor sidewalk\nrequirements. Street trees are required along core transit corridors with an average\nspacing not greater than 30 feet on center.)\n\n(See Figure 7 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with\nunderground utilities)\n\n(See Figure 8 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with\noverhead utility zone)\n\n(See Figure 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with\noverhead utility zone at curb)\n\n1.\n\nPlanting Zone.\n\na.\n\nThe planting zone shall have a minimum width of eight feet (from face of curb) and\nshall be continuous and located adjacent to the curb.\n\nb.\n\nThe zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than\n30 feet on center. The director shall adopt a list of acceptable street trees for\npurposes of this section. The list shall emphasize shade trees; however, alternative\ntrees may only be approved (pursuant to Section 2.2.2.B.3. below) where conflicts\nmay arise because of overhead utility lines.\n\nc.\n\nIn addition, the zone is intended for the placement of street furniture including\nseating, street lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper\nvending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric\ntransformers and water meters, and similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct\npedestrian access or motorist visibility.\n\n2.\n\nClear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of seven feet, shall be hardscaped, shall\nbe located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall comply with ADA and Texas Accessibility\nStandards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent element\nfor a minimum width of seven feet and a minimum height of eight feet.\n\n3.\n\nUtilities.\n\na.\n\nAll utility lines shall be underground from the building to the property line. Utility\nlines within the right-of-way shall be placed underground or relocated to the rear\nof the site to the maximum extent practicable.\n\nb.\n\nWhere electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, an overhead\nutility zone shall be provided so that no portion of the building is located within\na 10-foot radius of the energized conductor. This overhead utility zone shall be in\naddition to the minimum planting zone, clear zone, and supplemental zone (if provided).\nOptions for street tree planting and sidewalk placement in combination with overhead\nutilities are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.\n\n(See Figures 8 and 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088)\n\nc.\n\nOn lots with a depth of 120 feet or less and where electric utilities remain overhead\nand are located behind the curb, alternative trees from the list identified in Section\n2.2.2.B.1.b. above may be used so that the trees can be located beneath, rather than\noffset from, the overhead electric utilities.\n\n4.\n\nAlternative Requirements For Shallow Lots. On lots with a depth of 150 feet or less, the total sidewalk may be reduced to 12\nfeet, consisting of a seven-foot minimum planting zone and a five-foot clear zone.\n\nC.\n\nSupplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided at the option of the applicant between the street-facing\nfaçade line and the required clear zone. (See Figures 10 - 11.) The following standards\napply to supplemental zones:\n\n(See Figures 10 and 11 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Optional supplemental zone\nmay be expanded to 30 feet for a maximum of 30 percent of the frontage.)\n\n1.\n\nIf a supplemental zone is provided, up to 30 percent of the linear frontage of the\nsupplemental zone may be a maximum of 30 feet wide, and the remainder of the supplemental\nzone shall be a maximum of 20 feet wide. (See Figures 10 - 11.)\n\n2.\n\nElements that support active public uses can and should be located Within the supplemental\nzone, including one or more of the following:\n\na.\n\nAccessory outdoor dining, provided that the dining area may be separated from the\nsidewalk only with planters, shrubs, or fencing with a maximum height of 42 inches\n(See Figure 12.);\n\n(See Figure 12 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of supplemental zone\nwith outdoor dining.)\n\nb.\n\nBalconies, pedestrian walkways, porches, handicap ramps, and stoops; provided, however,\nthat no such feature shall extend beyond the supplemental zone without a license agreement;\n\nc.\n\nTerraces, provided that they have a maximum finished floor height of 24 inches above\nthe sidewalk elevation and shall be surrounded by a guardrail that meets city specifications;\n\nd.\n\nLandscape and water features;\n\ne.\n\nPlazas; and\n\nf.\n\nIncidental display and sales.\n\n3.\n\nOther improvements that support active uses as approved by the Director.\n\n4.\n\nAny features in the supplemental zone must not obstruct the open pedestrian connection\nbetween the building's primary entrance and the clear zone.\n\n5.\n\nA Transit Plaza adjacent to a Capital Metro, MetroRapid Station.\n\nD.\n\nBuilding Placement.\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Building Placement Standard. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at\nleast 75 percent of the net frontage length of the property along the Core Transit\nCorridor must consist of continuous building façade built up to the clear zone, or\nthe supplemental zone if one is provided. (See Figure 13.) For purposes of this Subchapter,\n\"net frontage length\" is defined in Article 5. This minimum net frontage length requirement\nshall not apply if the site qualifies for one of the exceptions in this subsection.\n\n(See Figure 13 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of permitted building\nplacement along Core Transit Corridors. Parking is not permitted in the hatched area\nbetween the street-facing façade and the sidewalk.)\n\n2.\n\nException: Civic Buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a distinctive architectural statement,\ncivic buildings, as defined in Article 5, do not have to be built up to the clear\nzone (or supplemental zone if one is provided), so long as parking is not located\nbetween the building frontage facing the principal street and the street. (See Figure\n14.)\n\n(See Figure 14 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; The Austin City Hall is set\nback from the street in some areas, while other non civic buildings meet the street.\nThis is a traditional urban design technique intended to emphasize the importance\nof civic uses.)\n\n3.\n\nException: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in\nor drive-through building may include a circulation lane of up to 20 feet in width\nbetween the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public\nroadway. The drive-in or drive-through building located behind the circulation lane\nneed not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking\nand must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation\naisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal entrance. (See Figure\n15.)\n\n(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced\nby a single curb cut do not have to meet the building placement standards in order\nto allow for a circulation lane.)\n\n4.\n\nException: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of\nthis building placement standard through the alternative equivalent compliance procedure\nin Section 1.5 because there will not be enough building frontage to meet the 75 percent\nnet frontage length requirement, the Director may approve an alternative design provided\none of the following is met, in addition to the criteria in Section 1.5.4.:\n\na.\n\nOn a site with a single principal building:\n\n(i)\n\nThe longer side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental\nzone if provided) (See Figure 16.), or\n\n(ii)\n\nAt least one side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental\nzone if provided) and the majority of the tenant spaces must have principal entrances\nfacing the principal street (See Figure 17.)\n\n(See Figures 16 and 17 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Alternative building placement\noptions.)\n\nb.\n\nOn a site with more than one principal building, at least one building must be built\nto the clear zone (or supplemental zone), and:\n\n(i)\n\nThe longer side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the principal\nstreet, must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided), or\n\n(ii)\n\nAt least one side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the\nprincipal street, must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided)\nand the majority of tenant spaces in any such building must have principal entrances\nfacing the principal street.\n\n5.\n\nExemption for Restaurant or Service Station Redevelopment. The building placement standards in this subsection do not apply to the redevelopment\nof an existing pad site restaurant or service station use by the owner or buyer if:\n\na.\n\nthe use proposed is a restaurant or service station;\n\nb.\n\nthe redevelopment occurs within the existing site configuration:\n\nc.\n\nsidewalks are provided in compliance with this section.\n\n6.\n\nException: Small Interior Lots. Development on interior lots with 65 feet or less of frontage on the principal street\nand with vehicular access only from the principal street is exempt from the building\nplacement standards of this subsection.\n\nE.\n\nOff-Street Parking.\n\n1.\n\nOff-street parking is prohibited between the Core Transit Corridor and the corresponding\nstreet-facing façade line. (See Figure 18.)\n\n(See Figure 18 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking to the side of a building\nis permitted but screening is required between the parking and the sidewalk. No parking\nis permitted between the building and the sidewalk on a Core Transit Corridor.)\n\n2.\n\nAny off-street surface parking along a Core Transit Corridor shall have landscape\nbuffering in accord with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC between the clear zone (or the supplemental zone if provided) and the\nparking area. The buffering method chosen must include shade trees.\n\n2.2.3.\n  Urban Roadways:\n\nSidewalks and Building Placement.\n\nA.\n\nApplicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:\n\n| Standard | Applies if the Principal Street Is: | Applies to the Following: |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2.2.3. Urban Roadways: Sidewalks and Building Placement | Urban Roadway | All non-residential zoning districts |\n\nB.\n\nPublic sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all Urban Roadways in accordance\nwith the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is required for\nall sites with frontage along an Urban Roadway regardless of principal street designation\nor building placement requirements, but a development located on one side of a street\nor right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite side of the street\nor right-of-way. A development that complies with the Great Streets standards adopted\nby Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt from the requirements\nof this section and may seek any reimbursements available under the Great Streets\nDevelopment program.\n\nFor development that is subject to the requirements of this section, sidewalks shall\nbe no less than 12 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part of the Alternative\nEquivalent Compliance process. (See Figure 19.) The 12-foot minimum requirement shall\napply regardless of the available right-of-way. Where required, the sidewalk shall\nextend onto private property to fulfill the 12-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk\neasement provided.\n\n(See Figure 19 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Urban roadway sidewalk width\nrequirements. Note that street trees are optional on urban roadways.)\n\nSidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb,\nand a clear zone. The following standards apply:\n\n1.\n\nPlanting Zone. The planting zone shall have a minimum width of seven feet and shall be continuous\nand located adjacent to the curb. In addition, the planting zone is intended for the\nplacement of street furniture including seating, street lights, waste receptacles,\nfire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks,\npublic utility equipment such as electric transformers and water meters, and similar\nelements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility.\n\n2.\n\nClear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of five feet, shall be hardscaped, shall\nbe located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall comply with ADA and Texas Accessibility\nStandards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed for a minimum width of five feet and\na minimum height of eight feet.\n\n3.\n\nUtilities. The standards for utility placement along core transit corridors shall also apply\nto utility placement along urban roadways. See Section 2.2.2.B.3. (See Figures 20\n- 22.)\n\n(See Figure 20 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Underground utilities on an\nUrban Roadway.)\n\n(See Figure 21 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Above ground utilities at curb\non an Urban Roadway.)\n\n(See Figure 22 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Above ground utilities on an\nUrban Roadway.)\n\nC.\n\nSupplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided, at the applicant's option, between the street-facing\nfaçade line and the required clear zone. If provided, the supplemental zone shall\nbe a maximum of 20 feet wide and shall comply with the standards above in Section\n2.2.2.C. (See Figure 23.)\n\n(See Figure 23 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Urban Roadway with optional\nsupplemental zone.)\n\nD.\n\nBuilding Placement.\n\n1.\n\nNotwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at\nleast 40 percent of the net frontage length along the Urban Roadway must consist of\ncontinuous building façade built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided).\n(See Figure 24.) Net frontage length is defined in Article 5.\n\n(See Figure 24 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of building placement\non Urban Roadways. Parking is generally not permitted in the hatched area between\nthe building façade and the sidewalk, except for shallow lots, as described in paragraph\nD.)\n\n2.\n\nException: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation\nlane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only\none point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-through building located\nbehind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation\nlane may not have parking and must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway\nthat crosses the circulation aisle and connects to the clear zone to the building's\nprincipal entrance. (See Figure 15.)\n\n(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced\nby a single curb cut do not have to meet the building placement standards in order\nto allow for a circulation lane.)\n\n3.\n\nException: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of this building placement standard through\nthe alternative equivalent compliance procedure in Section 1.5 because there will\nnot be enough building frontage to meet the 40 percent net frontage length requirement,\nthe Director may approve an alternative design provided one of the standards in Section\n2.2.2.D.4. is met, in addition to the criteria in Section 1.5.4.\n\n4.\n\nException: Restaurant or Service Station Redevelopment. The building placement standards in this subsection do not apply to the redevelopment\nof an existing pad site restaurant or service station use by the owner if:\n\na.\n\nthe use proposed is a restaurant or service station;\n\nb.\n\nthe redevelopment occurs within the existing site configuration;\n\nc.\n\nthe sidewalks are provided in compliance with this section.\n\n5.\n\nException: Small Interior Lots. Development on interior lots with 65 feet or less of frontage on the principal street\nand with vehicular access only from the principal street is exempt from the building\nplacement standards of this subsection.\n\nE.\n\nParking. Parking is prohibited between the building(s) and the property line adjacent to the\nUrban Roadway. However, on sites 400 feet deep or less, parking may be located between\nthe street-facing façade line and the Urban Roadway if:\n\n1.\n\nAt least 60 percent of the property's net frontage length along the Urban Roadway\nconsists of continuous building façade (divided into no more than two buildings) (see\nFigure 25), or 40 percent of the net frontage length consists of continuous vertical\nmixed use building façade (divided into no more than two buildings), built up to the\nclear zone (or supplemental zone if provided); and\n\n(See Figure 25 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking is permitted between\nthe building and the roadway on shallow lots less than 400 feet deep, when certain\nconditions are met.)\n\n2.\n\nAny surface parking along an Urban Roadway shall have landscape buffering in accord\nwith Section 252-1006 of the LDC between the clear zone (or the supplemental zone\nif provided) and the parking area; and\n\n3.\n\nA sidewalk, 4 minimum width, planted with trees at an average spacing not greater\nthan 30 on center or 4 awning, leads to the main customer entrance from the clear\nzone (or supplemental zone if provided).

Mixed use development integrates two or more land uses, such as residential and commercial, with a strong pedestrian orientation. Requirements and standards for mixed use development appear in various places throughout the Austin City Code. |\n| Zoning Districts in which Mixed Use is Allowed and Encouraged |\n| The following districts are intended primarily for mixed use development and are described more fully in Section 4.2 below: |\n| • Mixed Use Combining District (Section 4.2.1.). |\n| • Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District (Section 4.2.2.). |\n| Mixed use development also is allowed in other Austin zoning districts. Some of these districts are listed below and are described more fully in the referenced sections of the Austin Code. This list is not exhaustive, but rather is intended to illustrate the range of districts in which mixed use development is allowed. |\n| • Central Business (CBD) (Section 25-2-100); |\n| • Central Urban Redevelopment (CURE) (Section 25-2-163); |\n| • Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) (Section 25-2-101); |\n| • Planned Development Area (PDA) (Section 25-2-174); |\n| • Planned Unit Development (Section 25-2-144); |\n| • Traditional Neighborhood Development (Section 25-2-146); |\n| • Transit Oriented Development (Section 25-2-147); |\n| • Waterfront Overlay (WO) (Section 25-2-175); and |\n| • University Neighborhood Overlay (UNO) (Section 25-2-178). |\n| Types of Mixed Use Development |\n| Within the districts that allow mixed use development, uses may be combined either vertically in the same building, or horizontally in multiple buildings, or through a combination of the two, depending on the standards of the district. |\n| Vertical mixed use is allowed in two building types: the Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) Building and the Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) Building. Standards for VMU buildings are in Section 4.3. below, and standards for NMU buildings are in Subchapter D, Article 6. |\n| Horizontal mixed use is the mixing of uses in a development project, though not necessarily in the same building. Horizontal mixed use is allowed and encouraged in Austin so long as each of the proposed uses is allowed within the applicable zoning district and the development meets all applicable requirements of the Austin Code. |\n\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.\n\n4.2.1.\n  Mixed Use Combining District\n\nA.\n\nPurpose.
