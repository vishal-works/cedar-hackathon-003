No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.\n\n(A)\n\nThe City may offset the improvements or funding for construction of any system facility\nincluded on the roadway capacity plan that is required or agreed to by the City under\nthis section and administrative guidelines.\n\n(1)\n\nThe roadway facility shall be associated with the plat or other detailed plan of development\nfor the property that is to be served by the roadway facility.\n\n(2)\n\nNo offset shall be given for the dedication, funding, or construction of site-related\nfacilities.\n\n(3)\n\nNo offset shall be given for a roadway facility which is not identified within the\nroadway capacity plan unless the system facility qualifies for inclusion on the roadway\ncapacity plan and is incorporated within an allocation agreement with the City under\nSubsection (D).\n\n(4)\n\nThe value of any offset for a system facility shall be reduced by the City's cost\nparticipation in the construction or funding of such facility.\n\n(5)\n\nIf the amount of the offsets for a new development exceeds the total amount of street\nimpact fees due for the development, the remaining amount of the offsets may not be\ntransferred or assigned to other new developments for which street impact fees are\ndue, nor is the City responsible for reimbursing the property owner for such remaining\namount, unless an allocation agreement under Subsection (D) expressly so provides.\n\n(B)\n\nNo offsets shall be granted for the onsite dedication of rights-of-way or easements\nrequired by this chapter. Onsite dedication of rights-of-way or easements for roadway\nsystem facilities may be considered in determining the development's share of roadway\ninfrastructure improvement costs under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality of Required Infrastructure).\n\n(C)\n\nConstruction of capital improvements must be completed and accepted by the City in\norder to qualify as an offset with the following limitations:\n\n(1)\n\nConstruction completed and accepted before December 21, 2020, will only qualify as\nan offset until December 21, 2030.\n\n(2)\n\nConstruction that begins after December 21, 2020, will qualify as an offset for ten\nyears from the date the improvement is completed and accepted by the City unless the\napplicant is granted an extension.\n\n(D)\n\nBefore street impact fees can be reduced by offsets authorized under this section,\nthe owner of the property shall enter into an agreement with the City determining\nthe allocation of the offsets. Unless the allocation agreement specifies otherwise,\nan offset associated with a plat shall be applied when the first building permit is\nsubmitted and to each subsequent building permit application to reduce street impact\nfees due until the amount associated with the offset is exhausted.\n\n(E)\n\nMaster planned projects, including subdivisions containing multiple phases, whether\napproved before or after the effective date of the street impact fee regulations,\nmay apply for offsets against street impact fees for the entire project based upon\nimprovements or funds toward construction of system facilities. For projects where\ndevelopment has already occurred, the amount of any offset shall be reduced by the\nvalue attributable to any service units for which a building permit has been issued\nprior to one year from the effective date of this article. Offsets shall be spent\nwithin the same service area using a methodology approved by the City and incorporated\nwithin an agreement under Subsection (D).\n\n(F)\n\nFor new development that consists of multiple phases, the City may require that total\noffsets be proportionally allocated among phases within the new development.\n\nSource: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.\n\n(A)\n\nThe property owner or applicant for a new development may appeal the following administrative\ndecisions to the Land Use Commission:\n\n(1)\n\nThe applicability of a street impact fee to the development;\n\n(2)\n\nThe amount of the street impact fee due;\n\n(3)\n\nThe availability of, the amount of, or the expiration of an offset;\n\n(4)\n\nThe application of an offset against a street impact fee due;\n\n(5)\n\nThe amount of a refund due, if any; or\n\n(6)\n\nThe availability of a reduction against the collection of street impact fees.\n\n(B)\n\nBefore a public hearing is scheduled for Land Use Commission consideration, the property\nowner or applicant must meet with the director to discuss and attempt to resolve the\nissues raised by an appeal of an administrative decision.\n\n(C)\n\nThe property owner or applicant may appeal a Land Use Commission action on an administrative\ndecision to Council.\n\nSource: Ord.
