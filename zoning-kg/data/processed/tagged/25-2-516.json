No. 20231102-028, Pt. 21, 11-13-23.\n\n(A)\n\nThis section applies to a use that is nonconforming because of its proximity to a\nhazardous pipeline under Section 25-2-516(B) (Development Near a Hazardous Pipeline).\n\n(B)\n\nProximity to a hazardous pipeline does not cause a structure or area to be noncomplying\nunder Article 8 (Noncomplying Structures).\n\n(C)\n\nExcept as provided by Subsection (C), the use is governed by Group \"D\" regulations\nprescribed by Section 25-2-947 (Nonconforming Use Regulation Groups).\n\n(D)\n\nIf there is a conflict between the regulations prescribed by this section and the\nregulations as determined by Section 25-2-946 (Determination of Nonconforming Use Regulation Group), the more restrictive regulations apply.\n\nSource: Ord. 030410-12; Ord. 031211-11.",
