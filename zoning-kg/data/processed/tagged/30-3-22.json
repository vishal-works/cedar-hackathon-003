A person must comply with all dedication\nrequirements before the release of the subsequent application.\n\n(E)\n\nIn addition to the dedication of right-of-way, the single office may require the applicant\nto construct a roadway improvement or may assess a fee instead of requiring construction\nof a roadway improvement to offset the traffic effects generated by the proposed development.\n\n(F)\n\nNotwithstanding the other requirements of this section, roadway improvements are required\nonly to a degree that is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impact\nof the proposed development. To the extent that the full amount of right-of-way specified\nin this section is not required to be dedicated, the right-of-way is reserved and\nsubject to Section 30-3-22 (Constructing A Structure Or Improvement In Right-Of-Way Prohibited).\n\nSource: City Code Section 25-6-55; County Code Section 82.202(f) - (g); Ord. 031211-11;",
