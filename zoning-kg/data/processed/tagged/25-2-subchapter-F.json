A structure may not\nextend beyond a setback plane except as authorized by subsection D. below. The height\nof a setback plane shall be measured under the requirements defined in Section 3.4.\n\nA.\n\nSide Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection B. below, an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side\nsetback plane begins at a horizontal line 15 feet directly above the side property\nline. The 15-foot height of the horizontal line is established for 40-foot deep portions\nof the lot beginning at the building line and extending to the rear of the lot, except\nthat the last portion at the rear of the lot may be less than 40 feet deep. See Figures\n3 through 5.\n\n1.\n\nFor the first portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the\nhighest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines, the building\nline, and a line 40 feet from and parallel to the building line.\n\n2.\n\nFor successive portions other than the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal\nline is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the\nside lot lines and the appropriate two lines that are 40 feet apart and parallel to\nthe building line.\n\n3.\n\nFor the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the\nhighest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines, the appropriate\nline parallel to the building line, and the rear lot line.\n\n![Figure 3: Side Setback Plane Measured From Side Property Line](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig3.png)\n\nFigure 3: Side Setback Plane Measured From Side Property Line\n\n![Figure 4: (Elevation View) Dividing Lot into 40-foot Portions to Create Side Setback Planes (Rear Setback Plane Not Shown)](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig4.png)\n\nFigure 4: (Elevation View) Dividing Lot into 40-foot Portions to Create Side Setback\nPlanes (Rear Setback Plane Not Shown)\n\n![Figure 5: Determining High Points on a Sloping Lot](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig5.png)\n\nFigure 5: Determining High Points on a Sloping Lot\n\nFor each portion of the side setback plane, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line\nis measured starting from the highest point of the four intersections defining the\nportion.

The high points\nfor Portions 1, 2, and 3 are indicated, along with the Building Line.\n\nB.\n\nRear Setback Plane.

In this example, the minimum required\nstreet side yard setback in the underlying zoning district is 15 feet. Because the\nside setback plane is measured from the side property line, the height of the setback\nplane is 30 feet at the 15-foot street side yard setback line.\n\nD.\n\nSide and Rear Setback Plane Exceptions for Existing One-Story Buildings.\n\n1.\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story\nto a one-story building may choose either of the following side setback planes for\nthe portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed,\nor permitted for original construction, before October 1, 2006:\n\na.\n\nThe side setback plane required under subsection A.\n\nb.\n\nThe inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane that begins at a horizontal\nline directly above the outermost side wall at a height equal to the height of the\nfirst floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit\nbefore October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half feet.
