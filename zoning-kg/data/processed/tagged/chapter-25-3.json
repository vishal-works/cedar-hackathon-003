A traditional neighborhood district diversifies\nand integrates land uses within close proximity to each other, and it provides for\nthe daily recreational and shopping needs of the residents. A traditional neighborhood\ndistrict is a sustainable, long-term community that provides economic opportunity\nand environmental and social equity for the residents.\n\n(B)\n\nA traditional neighborhood district is designed to ensure the development of land\nas a traditional neighborhood. Its design adopts the urban conventions which were\nthe norm in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's. A traditional\nneighborhood district is characterized by the following design elements:\n\n(1)\n\nneighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity;\n\n(2)\n\na variety of housing types, jobs, shopping, services, and public facilities;\n\n(3)\n\nresidences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings interwoven within the neighborhood,\nall within close proximity;\n\n(4)\n\na network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the natural\nlandscape;\n\n(5)\n\nnatural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the open space of\nthe neighborhood;\n\n(6)\n\na coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities\nfor pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and automotive vehicles;\n\n(7)\n\nwell-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts,\nand parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood and dedicated to the collective\nsocial activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the populace;\n\n(8)\n\ncivic buildings, open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols,\nand focal points for community identity;\n\n(9)\n\ncompatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement,\nbulk, form, character, and landscaping to establish a livable, harmonious, and diverse\nenvironment;\n\n(10)\n\nprivate buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge and define the border between\nthe public street space and the private block interior; and\n\n(11)\n\narchitecture and landscape that respond to the unique character of the region.\n\nSource: Section 13-9-2; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.\n\n(A)\n\nA traditional neighborhood district consists of an area of not less than 40 contiguous\nacres and not more than 250 contiguous acres. In this chapter, property is considered\ncontiguous even if separated by a public roadway.\n\n(B)\n\nA traditional neighborhood district is divided into at least two types of Areas, and\neach type of Area has different land use and site development regulations. A traditional\nneighborhood district must have one Neighborhood Center Area and at least one Mixed\nResidential Area. A traditional neighborhood district may also have a Neighborhood\nEdge Area, a Workshop Area, or an Employment Center Area.\n\n(C)\n\nA Neighborhood Center Area serves as the focal point of a traditional neighborhood\ndistrict, containing retail, commercial, civic, and public services to meet the daily\nneeds of community residents. A Neighborhood Center is pedestrian-oriented, and it\nis designed to encourage pedestrian movement between a Mixed Residential Area and\na Neighborhood Center Area. A square is required in a Neighborhood Center Area. Retail\nand commercial uses should generally be located adjacent to a square. Neighborhood\nCenter Area uses include retail shops, restaurants, offices, banks, hotels, post office,\ngovernmental offices, churches, community centers, and attached residential dwellings.\n\n(D)\n\nA Mixed Residential Area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family\nresidential, duplex, townhouse, and multi-family. Residential scale retail and commercial\nuses are permitted within a Mixed Residential area with strict architectural and land\nuse controls. Retail and commercial uses in a Mixed Residential area are required\nto blend into the residential character of the neighborhood. A Mixed Residential area\nincludes open spaces including small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts.\nA Mixed Residential Area promotes pedestrian activity through well designed and varied\nstreetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic.\nMixed Residential Area uses include single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses,\napartments, offices, restaurants, neighborhood scale retail, and civic uses.\n\n(E)\n\nA Neighborhood Edge Area is the least dense portion of a traditional neighborhood\ndistrict, with larger lots and greater setbacks than the rest of the neighborhood.\nAlleys are not required, and direct vehicular access to the street is permitted. Only\nsingle family residential dwellings are permitted. A Neighborhood Edge Area is appropriate\nalong the perimeter of the neighborhood. A portion of a traditional neighborhood district\nthat adjoins existing or platted conventional low density housing must be designated\nas a Neighborhood Edge Area.\n\n(F)\n\nA traditional neighborhood district may have a Workshop Area, an Employment Center\nArea, or both. Commercial and light industrial uses that are not appropriate for a\nNeighborhood Center Area or a Mixed Residential Area but which serve the local residents\nmay be located in a Workshop Area. Large office and low-impact manufacturing uses\nmay be located within an Employment Center Area. The scale and architectural conventions\nof a traditional neighborhood district apply to a Workshop area and an Employment\nCenter Area.\n\n(G)\n\nCivic uses that are oriented to the general public are permitted in a Neighborhood\nCenter Area and a Mixed Residential Area. These uses are essential components of the\nsocial and physical fabric of a traditional neighborhood district. Special attention\nshould be paid to the location of government offices, libraries, museums, schools,\nchurches, and other prominent public buildings to create focal points and landmarks\nfor the community. The locations of these major public civic uses are designated on\nthe Development Plan at the time of zoning approval.\n\n(H)\n\nOpen space is a significant part of a traditional neighborhood district design. Formal\nand informal open spaces are required. These serve as areas for community gatherings,\nlandmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares,\nplazas, greens, preserves, parks, and greenbelts.\n\n(I)\n\nA traditional neighborhood district is designed to be pedestrian oriented. To accomplish\nthis goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle travel speeds and encourage\npedestrian activity. An interconnected network of streets and alleys is required.\nStreets may be smaller than in conventional development and more varied in size and\nform to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood.\n\nSource: Section 13-9-3; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 000309-39; Ord. 031211-11.\n\nIn this chapter:\n\n(1)\n\nCOMMUNITY PARKING FACILITY means an off-site parking lot or garage that provides required\nparking for some or all of the uses within a Neighborhood Center Area.\n\n(2)\n\nCRITERIA MANUAL means a manual containing administrative rules adopted in accordance\nwith Chapter 1-2 (Adoption of Rules) of the City Code.\n\n(3)\n\nDIRECTOR means the director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department of\nthe City of Austin.\n\n(4)\n\nFRONTAGE BUILDOUT means the length of a front building facade compared to the length\nof the front lot line, expressed as a percentage.\n\n(5)\n\nGREEN means an open space available for unstructured recreation, its landscaping consisting\nof grassy areas and trees.\n\n(6)\n\nGREENBELT means a series of connected open spaces that may follow natural features\nsuch as ravines, creeks, or streams.\n\n(7)\n\nMAJOR CIVIC USE includes Administrative and Business Offices use by a governmental\nentity, College and University Facilities use, Cultural Services use, Postal Facilities\nuse, Private Primary Educational Facilities use, Private Secondary Educational Facilities\nuse, Public Primary Educational Facilities use, Public Secondary Educational Facilities\nuse, Religious Assembly use, Safety Services use, and Transportation Terminal use.\n\n(8)\n\nMAJOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACE IMPROVEMENTS include swimming pools, tennis courts, basketball\ncourts, sports fields, recreation centers, and community meeting halls.\n\n(9)\n\nOPEN SPACE includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, and greenbelts.\n\n(10)\n\nPARK means an open space, available for recreation, its landscape consisting of paved\npaths and trails, some open lawn, trees, open shelters, or recreational facilities.\n\n(11)\n\nPLAZA means open space at the intersection of important streets, set aside for civic\npurposes and commercial activity, including parking, its landscape consisting of durable\npavement and formal tree plantings.\n\n(12)\n\nPRESERVE means open space that preserves or protects endangered species, a critical\nenvironmental feature, or other natural feature.\n\n(13)\n\nPRIVATE OPEN SPACE means open space that is owned and maintained by a Property Owners'\nAssociation or an individual property owner.\n\n(14)\n\nPUBLIC OPEN SPACE means open space that is owned and maintained by the City.\n\n(15)\n\nSIDE YARD HOUSE means a dwelling built adjacent to an interior side lot line with\na yard adjacent to the opposite side lot line.\n\n(16)\n\nSQUARE means open space that may encompass an entire block, is located at the intersection\nof important streets, and is set aside for civic purposes, with landscape consisting\nof paved walks, lawns, trees, and civic buildings.\n\n(17)\n\nSTREETSCAPE means the area within a street right of way that contains sidewalks, street\nfurniture, landscaping, or trees.\n\nSource: Section 13-9-4; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 010329-18; Ord. 031211-11.\n\n(A)\n\nThe Land Development Code applies to a traditional neighborhood district and development\nwithin it unless this chapter expressly provides otherwise.\n\n(B)\n\nThe requirements of this chapter supersede any inconsistent provisions of the City\nCode or other ordinance.\n\n(C)\n\nThe following provisions of the Land Development Code do not apply to a traditional\nneighborhood district or development within it:\n\n(1)\n\nChapter 25-2, Subchapter B, Article 2, Division 2 (Conditional Overlay Combining Districts), Division 4 (Neighborhood Conservation Combining District), Division 5 (Planned Unit Developments), and Division 6 (Planned Development Areas; Mixed Use Combining Districts);\n\n(2)\n\nChapter 25-2, Subchapter C, Article 3, Division 5 (Combining and Overlay Districts);\n\n(3)\n\nChapter 25-2, Subchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards);\n\n(4)\n\nSection 25-2-773 (Duplex, Two-Unit and Three-Unit Residential Uses);\n\n(5)\n\nSection 25-2-775 (Townhouses);\n\n(6)\n\nSection 25-2-776 (Condominium Residential Use);\n\n(7)\n\nSection 25-2-894 (Accessory Uses for a Principal Commercial Use);\n\n(8)\n\nSection 25-2-901 (Accessory Apartments);\n\n(9)\n\nChapter 25-4, Article 3 (Platting Requirements), except for Section 25-4-134 (Hazardous Pipelines);\n\n(10)\n\nChapter 25-5 (Site Plans);\n\n(11)\n\nChapter 25-6, Article 4, Division 2 (Roadways in Water Supply Rural Watersheds or Water Supply Suburban Watersheds);\n\n(12)\n\nChapter 25-6, Article 7 (Off-Street Parking and Loading); and\n\n(13)\n\nSection 25-6-171 (Standards for Design and Construction).\n\nSource: Section 13-9-5; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 030410-12; Ord. 031211-11; Ord.
