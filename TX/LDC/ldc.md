## § 25-2-474 - REQUIRED FINDINGS.

(A) The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement if it determines that:

    (1) the requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of property;

    (2) the hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property and is not generally characteristic of the area in which the property is located; and

    (3) development under the variance does not:

        (a) alter the character of the area adjacent to the property;

        (b) impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with the City requirements; or

        (c) impair the purposes of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located.

(B) The Board may grant a variance from a loading facility or off-street parking design requirements if, in addition to the findings required by Subsection (A), the Board determines that:

    (1) current or anticipated traffic volume generated by the use of the property or a nearby property does not reasonably require strict compliance with and enforcement of the requirement from which a variance is requested;

    (2) development under the variance does not result in parking or loading on public streets that interferes with the free flow of traffic on the streets; and

    (3) development under the variance does not create a safety hazard or any other condition that is inconsistent with the objectives of the Code.

(C) A variance granted under Subsection (B) applies only to the use for which the variance was granted and does not run with the land on which the use is located.

(D) A variance granted under Subsection (B) shall not apply to bicycle parking. An applicant may also seek a waiver pursuant to Code Section [§ 25-6-477](TIT25LADE_CH25-6TR_ART7OREPALO_DIV1GERE_S25-6-477BIPA)(F) (_Bicycle Parking_) to waive bicycle parking.

## § 25-2-476 - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.

(A) The Board of Adjustment shall grant a special exception for an existing residential structure, or portion of an existing structure, that violates a setback required under [Chapter 25-2](TIT25LADE_CH25-2ZO) (_Zoning_) if the board finds that the special exception meets the requirements of this section.

(B) The Board shall grant a special exception under Subsection (A) of this section if:

    (1) the residential use for which the special exception is sought is allowed in an SF-3 or more restrictive zoning district;

    (2) the building official performs an inspection and determines that the violation does not pose a hazard to life, health, or public safety; and

    (3) the Board finds that:

        (a) the violation has existed for:

            (i) at least 25 years; or

            (ii) at least 10 years, if the application for a special exception is submitted on or before June 6, 2017;

        (b) the use is a permitted use or a nonconforming use;

        (c) the structure does not share a lot with more than one other primary residence; and

        (d) granting a special exception would not:

            (i) alter the character of the area;

            (ii) impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with city code; or

            (iii) grant a special privilege that is inconsistent with other properties in the area or in the district in which the property is located.

(C) A special exception granted under this section:

    (1) applies only to the structure, or portion of a structure, for which the special exception was granted and does not run with the land;

    (2) may not authorize an increase in the degree of noncompliance or excuse compliance with minimum health and safety requirements; and

    (3) may not authorize a remodel or addition to the existing structure, except to the extent required by the building official to meet minimum life and safety requirements.

(D) A structure granted a special exception under this section shall be treated as a non-complying structure under [Chapter 25-2](TIT25LADE_CH25-2ZO), Article 8 (_Noncomplying Structures_).

## § 25-2-766.02 - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS DESCRIBED.

(A) A transit oriented development (TOD) district is classified according to its location, as described below.

(B) A neighborhood center TOD district is located at the commercial center of a neighborhood. The average density is approximately 15 to 25 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is one to six stories. Uses include small lot single-family residential use, single-family residential use with an accessory dwelling unit, townhouse residential use, low-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, neighborhood retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(C) A town center TOD district is located at a major commercial, employment, or civic center. The average density is approximately 25 to 50 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is two to eight stories. Uses include townhouse residential use, low- and mid-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(D) A regional center TOD district is located at the juncture of regional transportation lines or at a major commuter or employment center. The average density is more than 50 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is three to ten stories. Uses include mid-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, major retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(E) A downtown TOD district is located in a highly urbanized area. The average density is more than 75 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is six stories or more.

## § 25-2-766.03 - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ZONES DESCRIBED.

(A) A transit oriented development (TOD) district may be divided into zones of varying development intensity, as described in this section.

(B) A gateway zone is the area immediately surrounding the station platform, where passengers enter or exit transit vehicles. Typically, this area includes land that is about 300 to 500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone has a high level of transit integration, including streetscapes that connect the station platform with the surrounding buildings, and buildings that are oriented toward the station platform and provide ground floor pedestrian-oriented uses and employment or residential uses in the upper floors. A gateway zone has the highest density and building height in a TOD district.

(C) A midway zone is the area between a gateway zone and a transition zone, beginning at the outer boundary of the gateway zone and ending approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone is predominately residential, but it may also contain retail and office uses. The zone includes a variety of building types. A midway zone has density and building height that are lower than a gateway zone but higher than a transition zone.

(D) A transition zone is the area at the periphery of the TOD district. Development intensity is compatible with the existing or anticipated future development adjacent to the TOD district. A transition zone has the lowest density and building height in a TOD district.
