The Austin, Texas Code, has been kept current by regular supplementation by American
Legal Publishing Corporation.

Beginning with Supplement No. 96, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this
code current by regular supplementation.

Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were supplemented through September
2013. The source of each section is included in the source note appearing at the end
thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted
for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables
appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code,
as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.

The titles of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and
the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant
state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting
forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.

Chapter and Section Numbering System

The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used
in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts
separated by a dash. The figure before the second dash refers to the chapter number,
and the figure after the second dash refers to the position of the section within
the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1-3 is numbered 1-3-2, and the first
section of chapter 6-2 is 6-2-1. The next successive number shall be assigned to the
new article or division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of
chapters is maintained when including new chapters.

(Index or Indexes)

The (index or indexes) (has or have) been prepared with the greatest of care. Each
particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched
in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally
used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references
within the (index itself or indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct
the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.

Looseleaf Supplements

A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental
servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to
date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected
page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of
copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages
and deleting the obsolete pages.

Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder
of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility
of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.
It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately
upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be
saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Acknowledgments

This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President
of Supplementation, and Peggy Lamar, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee,
Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff
for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

The publisher is most grateful to Myrna Rios, Support Services Supervisor for her
cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It
is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of
Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens
and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

continuing to use the land in the manner in which it was being used on the date the
annexation proceedings were instituted, if the land use was legal at that time; or

(b)

beginning to use land in the manner that was planned before the 90
th
day before the effective date of the annexation if:

(i)

one or more licenses, certificates, permits, approvals, or other forms of authorization
by a governmental entity were required by law for the planned land use; and

(ii)

a completed application for the initial authorization was filed with the governmental
entity before the date the annexation proceedings were instituted.

(2)

Review Criteria. In determining whether a petition meets the standard for approval
under this subsection, the director shall consider the nature and extent of development
that:

(a)

occurred on the property prior to initiation of annexation proceedings, including
photographs or other evidence substantiating the use; or

(b)

was proposed in one or more required applications submitted to a governmental entity.

(3)

Date of Annexation. For purposes of this subsection, annexation proceedings are deemed
to have been instituted on the date of the first public hearing before the city council
on the annexation ordinance for the property.

(C)

The criteria in this section are intended to assist the director in reviewing Type
1 (Chapter 245) and Type 2 (Continuing Use) petitions for vested rights, but do not
limit the director from considering other factors relevant to the determination of
rights for a particular project. The director may consider whether a project is entitled
to common law vested rights if the project is not subject to Chapter 245 or Section
43.002 of the Local Government Code.

If the director approves a vested rights petition, any permit required to initiate,
continue, or complete the project shall be entitled to the development or continuing
use rights recognized by the vested rights determination, unless the project expires
under Division 3 (Expirations) of this article or other applicable regulations.

(A)

This section provides a voluntary mechanism for determining applicable regulations
where the extent of a project's vested rights are unclear and for incentivizing projects
with clearly established vested rights to achieve greater compliance with current
regulations.

(B)

An applicant may submit a request for a project consent agreement to the director,
in writing, after the director issues a vested rights determination under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights Determination) and before the application expires under Section 25-1-82 (Application Requirements and Expiration). The request must identify:

(1)

current regulations for which compliance would be required, other than regulations
exempt from vested rights protections under state law;

(2)

additional restrictions on the nature and intensity of the proposed development; and

(3)

any modifications or waivers requested as a condition to the agreement, including
but not limited to provisions for the transfer or averaging of impervious cover to
include additional property or changes to the original project that increase compatibility
with adjacent land uses.

(C)

The director may recommend a project consent agreement for approval to the city council
if the director finds that the agreement achieves a greater degree of environmental
protection and compatibility with adjacent land uses than would occur if a project
developed to the full extent of vested rights that have been verified or are reasonably
likely to exist for the project.

(D)

In making a determination under Subsection (C) of this section, the director shall
consider:

(1)

the degree to which vested rights for the project have been established;

(2)

the importance of particular regulations to achieving adopted planning goals or policies
for the area in which the project is located; and

(3)

a recommendation from the environmental officer regarding the environmental benefits
of the proposed agreement, if vested rights from the regulations of Chapter 25-8 (Environment) are asserted for the project.

(E)

The city council may consider approval of a project consent agreement under this section
only if the agreement is recommended by the director or initiated by the city council.
Before the council acts on a consent agreement, the director shall seek a recommendation
from the Environmental Board and the Land Use Commission, and the council shall hold
a public hearing. The director shall provide notice of the hearing under Section 25-1-132(B) (Notice of Public Hearing).

(F)

In acting on a project consent agreement, the city council may approve, deny, or modify
the agreement based on the standard applicable to the director's review under Subsections
(C) and (D) of this section. A project consent agreement may waive or modify site
development regulations applicable to a project as deemed appropriate by the city
council.

(G)

A project consent agreement for a project located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction
may include a development agreement as authorized under Section 212.172 of the Local
Government Code. The director shall review a proposed development agreement concurrent
with an application for a project consent agreement, but council may consider the
agreements separately or as a single agreement.

(H)

A project consent agreement is subject to the expiration requirements specified in
this subsection.

(1)

A project consent agreement approved by the city council expires on the 90
th
day after approval, unless the applicant has submitted a complete site plan application
for review by the director under the terms of the agreement.

(2)

Following submittal of a site plan application, a project consent agreement expires
if:

(a)

the site plan application expires under Section 25-1-82 (Application Requirements and Expiration); or

(b)

the site plan expires under Section 25-5-81 (Site Plan Expiration).

(3)

In approving a project consent agreement, the city council may extend the expiration
periods established under this subsection.

(B)

Guidelines adopted under this section for review of vested rights petitions may be
used to help address common questions that arise in determining vested rights, including
but not limited to:

(a)

whether a permit application is required to continue, complete, or initiate the project
for which vested rights are claimed;

(b)

whether the project for which vested rights are claimed has been completed, changed,
or expired; and

(c)

whether progress towards completion of a project has been made under Section 25-1-554 (Dormant Projects).

Source: Ord. No. 20231130-087, Pt. 2, 1-1-24.

(A)

For a development proposing single-family uses, parkland dedication will be satisfied
by the dedication of suitable land for park and recreational purposes in accordance
with this section or by payment of a fee in-lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication).

(B)

The following formula will apply to determine the amount of parkland dedication required:

![](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/25-1-602.png)

(C)

In calculating the amount of parkland to be dedicated, the number of residents per
unit is based on density as follows:

| Density Classification | Residents Per Unit |
| --- | --- |
| Low Density: Not more than 6 units per acre | 2.8 |
| Medium Density: More than 6 and not more than 12 units per acre | 2.2 |
| High Density: More than 12 units per acre | 1.7 |

(D)

If the density of a single-family development is not known:

(1)

the density is assumed to be the highest permitted in the zoning district, or if the
property is not zoned, 24 dwelling units per acre; or

(2)

for a residential subdivision within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the applicant
may reduce the assumed density by agreeing, in a manner that is enforceable by the
City and approved by the city attorney, that any subsequent increases in density may
require additional dedication of parkland under this section or payment of a fee in
lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication).

(E)

The amount of parkland required to be dedicated within the Parkland Dedication Urban
Core may not exceed 15% of gross site area for the development required to provide
the dedication except upon consent of the applicant or as authorized under this subsection.

(1)

The director may request that the Land Use Commission approve dedication greater than
15% off the gross site area, up to the amount required under Subsection (B) of this
section, if doing so is necessary to:

(a)

address a critical shortage of parkland for an area identified in the Deficient Parkland
Area Map; or

(b)

provide connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational amenities.

(2)

Before the Land Use Commission considers a request under this subsection for approval,
the director shall present the request to the Parks Board for a recommendation.

(3)

In considering a request from the director under this subsection, the Land Use Commission
may:

(a)

deny the director's request and limit the required dedication to no more than 15%
of gross site area; or

(b)

require additional parkland dedication greater than the 15% if gross site area, up
to the lesser of:

(i)

the amount required under Subsection (B) of this section; or

(ii)

the minimum amount the Land Use Commission finds to be necessary based on the criteria
in Paragraph (l)(a)-(b) of this subsection and the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.

(4)

If an applicant dedicates less than the amount of land required for dedication under
Subsection (B) due to the cap imposed by this subsection, the director shall require
payment of a fee in-lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee in Lieu of Parkland Dedication) for the remaining undedicated land.

Source: Ord. No. 20231130-087, Pt. 2, 1-1-24.

(A)

For a development application proposing multi-family uses, the director shall determine
how the applicant will satisfy applicable parkland dedication requirements. The director
may require the applicant to:

(1)

dedicate land that meets the criteria in Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) as parkland;

(2)

pay a parkland dedication fee under Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee); or

(3)

dedicate land that meets the criteria in Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) as parkland and pay a reduced parkland dedication fee calculated under Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee).

(B)

In determining how an applicant will satisfy their parkland dedication requirements
under this article, the director shall consider whether the development:

(1)

is located within the Deficient Park Area Map;

(2)

is adjacent to existing parkland;

(3)

has sufficient acreage to meet the standards for dedicated parkland under the Parkland
Dedication Operating Procedures;

(4)

is needed to address a critical need for parkland or to remedy a deficiency identified
by the Deficient Park Area Map; or

(5)

would provide increased connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational
amenities.

(C)

Subject to Subsection (D), if the director is requiring an applicant to satisfy their
parkland dedication requirements entirely through land dedication, the following formula
will apply to determine the amount of land required:

[# of multifamily units × .005] + [# of hotel/motel rooms × .004] = Acres of parkland

(D)

The amount of land required to be dedicated may not exceed 10% of gross site area
of the development.

(E)

If a development application proposes both multi-family and commercial uses, the amount
of land dedication required is based on a prorated portion of the land proposed for
the multi-family use.

Source: Ord. No. 20231130-087, Pt. 2, 1-1-24.

(A)

In addition to the requirements of this article, land to be dedicated as parkland
must meet the requirements of this subsection.

(1)

Parkland must be easily accessible to the public and open to public view so as to
benefit area residents, enhance the visual character of the City, protect public safety,
and minimize conflicts with adjacent land uses.

(2)

On-street and off-street connections between residential neighborhoods shall be provided,
wherever possible, to provide reasonable access to parks and open space areas.

(3)

In addition to the requirements of this subsection, parkland must comply with the
standards in the Comprehensive Plan, the Parks and Recreation Long-Range Plan, the
Environmental Criteria Manual, and the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.

(4)

If an applicant is proposing multifamily uses, the parkland shall not be encumbered
with restrictions that will negatively impact the parkland's ability to be used for
recreational purposes with park amenities unless:

(a)

there is no feasible and prudent alternative land available for parkland dedication
as determined by the director; and

(b)

the land will provide a critical greenbelt or trail connection with sufficient recreational
opportunities.

(B)

The director shall determine whether land offered for dedication complies with the
standards for dedication under Subsection (A) and may require a subdivision or site
plan applicant to provide information deemed necessary to determine compliance.

(C)

If an applicant is proposing single-family uses, then the director may allow land
that does not otherwise meet the standards under Subsection (A) to be dedicated as
parkland if the land meets the requirements of this subsection.

(1)

50 percent of acreage in the 100-year floodplain that is dedicated as parkland may
be credited toward fulfilling the requirements of this article if any adjoining land
within the 25-year floodplain is also dedicated as parkland. The land within the 25-year
floodplain may not be credited toward fulfilling the requirements of this article,
unless it complies with Subdivision 25-l-604(C)(2).

(2)

Land identified on the Deficient Parkland Area Map may be accepted if the director
determines that the land will provide recreational or educational opportunities for
the surrounding community. If the director determines the land has recreational or
educational opportunities, 50 percent of the acreage may be credited toward fulfilling
the requirements of this article.

(D)

If land dedication is required for subdivision approval, the area to be dedicated
must be shown on the preliminary plan and final plat as "Parkland Dedicated to the
City of Austin." The subdivider shall dedicate to the City all parkland required by
this article when a plat is approved, except that the director may defer dedication
of parkland to site plan approval if development within the subdivision will require
a site plan under Chapter 25-5 (Site Plan).

(E)

If land dedication is required for site plan approval, the area to be dedicated must
be shown on the site plan as "Parkland Dedicated to the City of Austin". Unless the
director has deferred the land dedication until the time of issuance of a certificate
of occupancy under Subsection (F), the applicant shall dedicate the parkland required
by this article to the City by deed or easement before the site plan is released.

(F)

The director may defer the land dedication until the time of issuance of a certificate
of occupancy if the land proposed to be dedicated is necessary for the construction
of the proposed development and the applicant will restore the parkland. If the director
authorizes the deferral of land dedication until this subsection, the development
shall not receive any type of certificate of occupancy, temporary or permanent, until
the land has been dedicated.

(G)

For a building permit that is required to dedicate parkland the area must be dedicated
in a deed or easement to the City. The applicant shall dedicate to the City all parkland
required by this article before a building permit is issued.

(H)

The applicant shall pay all costs of transferring the parkland to the City, including
the costs of:

(1)

an environmental site assessment without any further recommendations for clean-up,
certified to the City not earlier than the 120th day before the closing date;

(2)

a Category 1(a) land title survey, certified to the City and the title company not
earlier than the 120th day before the closing date;

(A)

For single-family development, the director may require or allow an applicant to deposit
with the City a fee in lieu of parkland dedication under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland) if:

(1)

the director determines that payment of a fee in lieu of dedication is justified under
the criteria in Subsection (B) of this section; and

(2)

the following additional requirements are met:

(a)

less than six acres is required to be dedicated under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland); or

(b)

the land available for dedication does not comply with the standards for dedication
under Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland).

(B)

In determining whether to require dedication of land under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland) or allow payment of a fee in lieu of dedication under this section, the director
shall consider whether the subdivision or site plan:

(1)

is located within the Deficient Park Area Map;

(2)

is adjacent to existing parkland;

(3)

has sufficient acreage to meet the standards for dedicated parkland under the Parkland
Dedication Operating Procedures;

(4)

is needed to address a critical need for parkland or to remedy a deficiency identified
by the Deficient Park Area Map; or

(5)

would provide increased connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational
amenities.

(C)

The amount of the fee in lieu of parkland is established in the annual fee schedule
based on a recommendation by the director in accordance with this subsection.

(1)

Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Dedication:

| Density Classification | Fee In Lieu Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Low Density: Not more than 6 units per acre | 2.8 × Land Cost Per Person |
| Medium Density: More than 6 and not more than 12 units per acre | 2.2 × Land Cost Per Person |
| High Density: More than 12 units per acre | 1.7 × Land Cost Per Person |

(2)

For purposes of determining the amount of single-family fee in lieu under Subdivision
(D)(1):

Land Cost Per Person =

Parkland Cost Factor

Parkland Level-of-Service

where:

(a)

"Parkland Cost Factor" is determined by the director based on the average purchase
price to the City for acquiring an acre of parkland, excluding a metro or district
park or golf course; and

(b)

"Parkland Level-of-Service" is:

City Population

Net Park Acreage

where "City Population" is determined by the city demographer and "Net Park Acreage"
is the total citywide acreage of neighborhood parks, pocket parks, and greenways,
as determined by the director prior to adoption of the annual fee ordinance by the
city council.

(D)

If the director determines that payment of a fee in lieu of parkland dedication is
authorized under this section for only a portion of the land required to be dedicated
under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland), the director may allow an applicant to pay a fee in lieu for that portion and require
that the remaining land be dedicated. If an applicant dedicates parkland under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland), the director may not include that acreage in calculating the fee in lieu required
by this section for any remaining land not included in the dedication.

Except as provided in Subsection (C), an applicant proposing single-family development
must pay a parkland development fee as a condition to subdivision or site plan approval
to ensure that land is developed with recreational amenities sufficient for park use.

(B)

The amount of the development fee is established in the annual fee schedule based
on a recommendation by the director in accordance with this subsection.

| Medium Density: More than 6 and not more than 12 units per acre | 2.2 × Park Development Cost Per Person |
| High Density: More than 12 units per acre | 1.7 × Park Development Cost Per Person |

(2)

For purposes of determining the parkland development fee under Subdivision (B)(1):

Park Development Cost =

Park Development Cost Factor

Park Facilities Level-of-Service

where:

(a)

"Park Development Cost Factor" is determined by the director based on the average
cost of developing an acre of parkland up to the standards of a neighborhood park;
and

(b)

"Park Facilities Level-of-Service" is:

City Population

Number of Developed Parks

where "City Population" is determined by the city demographer and "Number of Developed
Parks" is the total number of parks developed with a recreational amenity or trail,
as determined by the director prior to adoption of the annual fee ordinance by the
city council.

(C)

The director may allow an applicant to construct recreational amenities on public
parkland or private parkland, if applicable, in lieu of paying the development fee
required by this section. In order to utilize this option, the applicant must:

(1)

post fiscal surety in an amount equal to the development fee;

(2)

if a dedication of land is required, construct recreational amenities prior to the
dedication in a manner consistent with the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures;
and

(3)

document the required amenities concurrent with subdivision or site plan approval,
in a manner consistent with the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.

(A)

For purposes of determining the amount of a parkland dedication fee required for approval
of a development permit proposing multi-family development, City Council has designated
all the land within its municipal boundaries into geographic areas via separate ordinance.
These designations may be modified as set out under state law.

(B)

The dwelling unit factor shall be:

(1)

.005 for multi-family units; and

(2)

.004 for rooms in a hotel or motel ordinarily used for sleeping.

(C)

The density factor shall be:

(1)

one for the suburban area;

(2)

four for the urban area; and

(3)

forty for the central business district area.

(D)

Every 10 years, the City will use the average land value for each geographic area
calculated by the applicable appraisal district. For the years in which the applicable
appraisal district does not calculate the average land value, the City shall calculate
the average land value for each geographic area by multiplying the previous year's
average land value for each geographic area by one plus the average CPI for each month
of the previous year.

(E)

If the director has determined that an applicant will satisfy their parkland dedication
requirements entirely by paying a parkland dedication fee, the dollar amount required
is calculated using the following formula:

{[(# of multifamily units) × .005] + [(# of hotel/motel rooms) × .004]} × (Avg Land
Value of Geographic Area)/Density Factor

(1)

First, add the product of the number of multifamily units proposed to be developed
by .005 and the product of the number of hotel and motel rooms ordinarily used for
sleeping proposed to be developed by .004.

(2)

Then, multiply the sum calculated under Subdivision (E)(1) by the average land value
for the geographic area where the development is located.

(3)

Finally, divide the number calculated under Subdivision (E)(2) by the applicable density
factor.

(F)

If the director has determined that an applicant is satisfying their parkland dedication
requirements through dedicating land and paying a parkland dedication fee, the dollar
amount of parkland dedication fee owed is calculated using the following formula:

[Parkland dedication fee per Subsection (E)] - [(Applicable land value) × (# of acres)]

(1)

First, calculate the amount of fee using the formula described in Subsection (E).

(2)

Then, subtract the product of the land value applicable to the land and the number
of acres dedicated from the total amount of the parkland dedication fee.

(G)

If the applicant is dedicating land and paying a reduced fee, the applicant will only
be required to dedicate for development approval an acreage amount that has a land
value that does not exceed the amount of parkland dedication fee calculated under
this section. Additionally, the acreage amount shall not exceed 10% of gross site
area of the development.

(H)

If there is a remaining amount of parkland dedication fee after subtracting the land
value of the acreage required to be dedicated as parkland, the applicant may choose
to construct recreational facilities on the future parkland in lieu of paying the
remaining parkland dedication fee amount. The recreational facilities must be shown
on the subdivision or site plan application and constructed before the land is dedicated.

(A)

Payment of a fee required under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) or Section 25-1-607 (Single-Family Parkland Development Fee) must be paid as required by this subsection.

(1)

If a fee in lieu of dedication or a parkland development fee is required as a condition
to subdivision approval, the applicant must deposit the fee with the City before final
plat approval. The applicant may defer payment of a fee until site plan approval unless
development proposed within the subdivision is exempt from the requirement to submit
a site plan under Section 25-5-2 (Site Plan Exemptions).

(2)

If a fee in lieu of dedication or a parkland development fee is required as a condition
to site plan approval, the applicant must deposit the fee with the City before the

Except as provided in Subsection (C)(2), the director shall use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) and Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee) solely to acquire land or easements for park purposes that will benefit residents
of the development for which the fees are assessed and are located within a service
area designated by the director under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.

(2)

The director may use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) and Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee) and consistent with the purposes described in Subsection (C)(3) if, after one year
from the date the fees are collected for expenditure, the director determines that
land which meets the requirements of Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) is unavailable for purchase within the service area for which the fees were assessed.

(3)

The director shall use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) to acquire and develop recreational amenities that will benefit residents of the
development for which the fees are assessed and are located within a service area
designated by the director under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures. If,
after one year from the date the single-family parkland development fees are collected
for expenditure, the director determines there are no longer any parks within the
service area for which fees were assessed that need new recreational facilities, then
the parkland development fees can be used to acquire land or easements for park purposes
that will benefit residents of the development for which the fees are assessed and
are located within a service area designated by the director under the Parkland Dedication
Operating Procedures.

(D)

The City shall expend a fee collected under this article within five years from the
date the fees are appropriated for expenditure by the director. This period is extended

required under Paragraph (C)(1).

(4)

Refund Procedures. The program shall establish procedures by which an applicant who
paid a tenant relocation fee under Section 25-1-715 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—Developer Funded) may request a refund of any fees not spent for an authorized purpose within ten

(G)

Neighborhood plan contact teams shall have dispute resolution as follows:

(1)

Filing complaints. A person who meets the membership requirements described under
Subsection (B) and believes that the neighborhood plan contact team has violated the
provisions of this section may file with the director a request to have the director
investigate and mediate the complaint. Such complaints shall be in writing and shall
identify the neighborhood plan contact team alleged to be violating the provisions

shall conduct a prompt and full investigation of the matter stated in the complaint
through interviews with the charging party, contact team officers, and through review
of all available documentation. The director shall determine in writing whether dispute
resolution is warranted within 14 days of receiving a complaint and shall render a

believe that dispute resolution is warranted, and the director is unable to secure
from the respondent an acceptable conciliation agreement, the director shall present
a report to the Planning Commission within 30 days of completing the informal dispute
resolution. If after review of the report the Planning Commission agrees with the
report of the director, the Planning Commission may recommend a more formal mediation
or dispute resolution process. The Planning Commission shall set a deadline for the
completion of formal mediation based on the complexity and circumstances of a specific
case and shall identify a neutral third party to conduct the dispute resolution process.

Remedy.

(a)

In cases where the informal and formal dispute resolution processes initiated by the

the Planning Commission may recommend that the director and the City discontinue recognition
of the neighborhood plan contact team under the provisions of this chapter until a
conciliation agreement acceptable to the Planning Commission is reached.

In the event the City discontinues recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team,
special designation of the organization as a neighborhood plan contact team will be
removed from the City of Austin Community Registry, the neighborhood plan contact
team will no longer be granted the authority to initiate Neighborhood Plan amendments,
and the neighborhood plan contact team will no longer have access to any special resources
or authority through the City based on its status as a neighborhood plan contact team.

(c)

If recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team is discontinued for more than six
months, the director may take action to initiate a new neighborhood plan contact team
for the planning area under the provisions of City Code Section 25-1-805(A)—(C). In the event that the director takes action to initiate a new neighborhood
plan contact team, the initial officers of the new neighborhood plan contact team
may not have served as officers of the previous neighborhood plan contact team at
the time when recognition was discontinued.

(6)

Appeal. Charging parties and respondents may appeal the determination of the director
and of the Planning Commission under this subsection to the City Council. Actions
that are appealable include the director's determination that dispute resolution is
warranted; findings/determinations that come out of the informal dispute resolution
process; and discontinuation of recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team.

SUBCHAPTER D. - NEIGHBORHOOD PLAN COMBINING DISTRICTS.

### ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS.

The Planning Commission may, by resolution, adopt guidelines for the interpretation
by the building official of yard and setback requirements in instances where geometric
shape, dimensions, or topography make the literal interpretation of the requirements
impractical.

Source: Section 13-2-613; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide a request for a variance from a requirement
of this chapter, or a Neighborhood Conservation Combining District adopted under this
chapter, except as otherwise provided by the Code.

Source: Section 13-2-833 (1); Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11; Ord. 20101216-095.

(A)

A variance from the requirements of this chapter, or a Neighborhood Conservation Combining
District adopted under this chapter, may be granted under this division if, because
of special circumstances of a property, the strict application of this chapter deprives
the property owner of privileges that are enjoyed by another person who owns property
in the area that has the same zoning designation as the property for which the variance
is requested.

(B)

A variance to a regulation may not grant special privileges that are inconsistent
with the limitations on other properties in the area or on the district in which the
property is located.

Source: Section 13-2-830; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11; Ord. 20101216-095.

(A)

The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement if it determines that:

(1)

the requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of property;

(2)

the hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property and is
not generally characteristic of the area in which the property is located; and

(3)

development under the variance does not:

(a)

alter the character of the area adjacent to the property;

(b)

impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with the City
requirements; or

(c)

impair the purposes of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property
is located.

(B)

The Board may grant a variance from a loading facility or off-street parking design
requirements if, in addition to the findings required by Subsection (A), the Board
determines that:

(1)

current or anticipated traffic volume generated by the use of the property or a nearby
property does not reasonably require strict compliance with and enforcement of the
requirement from which a variance is requested;

(2)

development under the variance does not result in parking or loading on public streets
that interferes with the free flow of traffic on the streets; and

(3)

development under the variance does not create a safety hazard or any other condition
that is inconsistent with the objectives of the Code.

(C)

A variance granted under Subsection (B) applies only to the use for which the variance
was granted and does not run with the land on which the use is located.

(D)

A variance granted under Subsection (B) shall not apply to bicycle parking. An applicant
may also seek a waiver pursuant to Code Section § 25-6-477(F) (Bicycle Parking) to waive bicycle parking.

Source: Section 13-2-834; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11; Ord. 20130523-104; Ord. No. 20231102-028, Pt. 8, 11-13-23.

A person may appeal a decision of the building official regarding a site development
regulation prescribed by this subchapter, or by a Neighborhood Conservation Combining
District adopted under this chapter, to the Board of Adjustment. After an appeal is
filed, the building official shall provide the board with a copy of documents regarding
the matter that has been appealed.

(A)

The Board of Adjustment shall grant a special exception for an existing residential
structure, or portion of an existing structure, that violates a setback required under
Chapter 25-2 (Zoning) if the board finds that the special exception meets the requirements of this section.

(B)

The Board shall grant a special exception under Subsection (A) of this section if:

(1)

the residential use for which the special exception is sought is allowed in an SF-3
or more restrictive zoning district;

(2)

the building official performs an inspection and determines that the violation does
not pose a hazard to life, health, or public safety; and

(3)

the Board finds that:

(a)

the violation has existed for:

(i)

at least 25 years; or

(ii)

at least 10 years, if the application for a special exception is submitted on or before
June 6, 2017;

(b)

the use is a permitted use or a nonconforming use;

(c)

the structure does not share a lot with more than one other primary residence; and

(d)

granting a special exception would not:

(i)

alter the character of the area;

(ii)

impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with city code;
or

(iii)

grant a special privilege that is inconsistent with other properties in the area or
in the district in which the property is located.

(C)

A special exception granted under this section:

(1)

applies only to the structure, or portion of a structure, for which the special exception
was granted and does not run with the land;

(2)

may not authorize an increase in the degree of noncompliance or excuse compliance
with minimum health and safety requirements; and

(3)

may not authorize a remodel or addition to the existing structure, except to the extent
required by the building official to meet minimum life and safety requirements.

(D)

A structure granted a special exception under this section shall be treated as a non-complying
structure under Chapter 25-2, Article 8 (Noncomplying Structures).

A transit oriented development (TOD) district is classified according to its location,
as described below.

(B)

A neighborhood center TOD district is located at the commercial center of a neighborhood.
The average density is approximately 15 to 25 dwelling units for each acre. Typical
building height is one to six stories. Uses include small lot single-family residential
use, single-family residential use with an accessory dwelling unit, townhouse residential
use, low-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, neighborhood
retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(C)

A town center TOD district is located at a major commercial, employment, or civic
center. The average density is approximately 25 to 50 dwelling units for each acre.
Typical building height is two to eight stories. Uses include townhouse residential
use, low- and mid-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use,
retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(D)

A regional center TOD district is located at the juncture of regional transportation
lines or at a major commuter or employment center. The average density is more than
50 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is three to ten stories.
Uses include mid-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use,
major retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.

(E)

A downtown TOD district is located in a highly urbanized area. The average density
is more than 75 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is six stories
or more. Uses include mid- and high-rise condominium residential use and multifamily
residential use, large retail and office uses, and mixed use buildings.

(A)

A transit oriented development (TOD) district may be divided into zones of varying
development intensity, as described in this section.

(B)

A gateway zone is the area immediately surrounding the station platform, where passengers
enter or exit transit vehicles. Typically, this area includes land that is about 300
to 500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone has a high level of transit
integration, including streetscapes that connect the station platform with the surrounding
buildings, and buildings that are oriented toward the station platform and provide
ground floor pedestrian-oriented uses and employment or residential uses in the upper
floors. A gateway zone has the highest density and building height in a TOD district.

(C)

A midway zone is the area between a gateway zone and a transition zone, beginning
at the outer boundary of the gateway zone and ending approximately 1,000 to 1,500
feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone is predominately residential,
but it may also contain retail and office uses. The zone includes a variety of building
types. A midway zone has density and building height that are lower than a gateway
zone but higher than a transition zone.

(D)

A transition zone is the area at the periphery of the TOD district. Development intensity
is compatible with the existing or anticipated future development adjacent to the
TOD district. A transition zone has the lowest density and building height in a TOD
district.

## SUBCHAPTER E: - DESIGN STANDARDS AND MIXED USE.

Editor's note:

Background: On February 26, 2004, the Austin City Council directed the City Manager
by resolution "… to prepare recommendations for citywide design standards for commercial
and retail development. These recommended citywide design standards shall constitute
the best practices of the standards adopted by communities around the nation and shall
require design standards that reflect Austin's unique historic, landscape and architectural
character…"

In order to implement the Council's direction, a specially appointed Task Force met
over several months to consider research and input from the public, various stakeholder
groups, and individuals. The Task Force sought to understand the preferences of Austin
citizens and the design regulations of other cities prior to developing a recommendation.

The Task Force produced, and in May 2005 the City Council adopted, a policy report
entitled "Raising the Design Standards in Austin, Texas." The Task Force report identified
a number of areas where regulatory improvements are necessary in order to raise the
bar of development quality in Austin. The general intent was to develop regulations
that will foster a built environment of aesthetic and sustainable value, enhance economic
development efforts, promote Austin's unique character and natural environment, and
ensure an efficient development review process.

The proposals for new standards were intended to raise the level of quality for all
non-residential and mixed-use development, but within a regulatory structure offering
options and flexibility, not strict requirements. New development would be subject
to a set of minimum site and building design standards, recognizing that all new development,
regardless of size, should be subject to minimum standards. The following topics were
addressed in the Task Force report: Development orientation; Parking; Land use; Signs;
Stormwater management; Connectivity; Exterior lighting; Screening and compatibility;
and Building design.

In each of these topic areas, the Task Force report discussed the key issue generally
and proposed regulatory language to address the issue. In a few areas, specific ordinance
language was proposed, but in most areas the proposed language recommended general
approaches rather than actual ordinance language. In some areas, the proposed new
standards would be new for Austin, while in other areas the proposed standards would
require amendments to the Austin Code.

This Subchapter is intended to implement the Task Force report by establishing a clear,
user-friendly, and legally enforceable ordinance that will result in improved development
quality in Austin. This Subchapter is officially known as Subchapter E of Chapter 25-2 of the City Code. This Subchapter was adopted on August 31, 2006, and will become
effective on January 13, 2007. The Task Force recommends reviewing this Subchapter
once it has been in place for one year.

How to use this Subchapter:

Applicability is Based on Adjacent Roadway and Type of Development: This Subchapter
recognizes that development should reflect and respond to its location within the
city. For example, a commercial development in a suburban location can (and often
should) look and function differently than a commercial development in downtown Austin.
Because roadways provide both access to a site and define the urban design framework
of the city, roadway types have been used as an organizing tool to establish many
of the new development standards in this Subchapter. This approach is intended to
help ensure a cohesive development pattern along Austin's streets and remove some
of the inconsistency that arises from having a variety of zoning districts fronting
a single roadway.

Because many of the standards in this Subchapter are defined based on roadway type(s)
near the property, an important first step in the development process is to determine
the roadway types that are adjacent to a site. The size of the site and the type of
development (residential, commercial, mixed use, etc.) also need to be considered,
since different standards may apply. The applicability chart in Article 1 summarizes
the applicability of all the standards in this Subchapter, based on type of adjacent
roadways and development activity.

The following different types of roadways are identified in this Subchapter:

Core Transit Corridors include roadways that have or will have a sufficient population
density, mix of uses, and transit facilities to encourage and support transit use.
Existing Core Transit Corridors have been designated and are defined in Article 5
and shown on Figure 1. Examples include South Congress Avenue (north of Stassney Lane)
and Anderson Lane (between Burnet Road and Mopac). Additional Core Transit Corridors
may be designated in the future through neighborhood planning processes.

Hill Country Roadways are those roadways identified in Section 25-2-1103, such as RM 2222 and Southwest Parkway. Standards in this Subchapter that reference
the Hill County Roadway designation apply to all properties within 1000 feet of these
roadways.

Highways include all freeways, parkways, expressways, and frontage roads identified
in the Austin Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan, except for Core Transit Corridors.

Internal Circulation Routes are public streets or private drives edged by a curb within
a development.

Suburban Roadways are roads outside the Urban Roadway Boundary, defined below and
shown on Figure 2, that are not Core Transit, Hill Country, or Highway Roadways.

Urban Roadways are roads other than those designated as Core Transit Corridors and
Highways located within the following boundaries, as shown on Figure 2:

183 from Burnet to Hwy 71

Hwy 71 from 183 to Loop 1

Loop 1 from Hwy 71 to Lake Austin

Lake Austin from Loop 1 to Exposition

Exposition from Lake Austin to 35th

35th from Exposition to Loop 1

Loop 1 from 38th to RM 2222

RM 2222 from Loop 1 to Mesa

Mesa from RM 2222 to Spicewood Springs Road

Spicewood Springs Road from Mesa to 360

360 from Spicewood Springs Road to Great Hills Trail

How this Subchapter is organized:

This Subchapter is divided into five Articles.

Article 1 includes General Provisions that should be reviewed for all development
and redevelopment projects. Most importantly, a chart summarizes the applicability
of the various standards based on roadway types and development types.

To allow flexibility in administering this Subchapter, this Article includes a "minor
modification" provision that allows for City staff to approve small deviations from
otherwise applicable standards in order to protect natural or historic features or
to address unique site conditions.

The Article also encourages creativity and innovative design by allowing an applicant
to propose an alternative approach to meeting the standards of the Subchapter through
the "alternative equivalent compliance" provision.

Article 2 includes Site Development Standards intended to ensure that buildings relate
appropriately to surrounding developments and streets, promote efficient pedestrian
and vehicle circulation, and provide parking in safe and appropriate locations, while
creating a unique and identifiable image for development in Austin. In particular,
standards in this Article address the following:

Relationship of buildings to streets and walkways (based on roadway type);

Connectivity (based on roadway type);

Exterior lighting;

Screening of equipment and utilities; and

Private common open space and pedestrian amenities.

Article 3 includes Building Design Standards intended to address the physical appearance
of buildings subject to this Subchapter. Included are:

General requirements for glazing and shading to ensure that building façades are pedestrian-friendly;
and

Additional options to improve building design. An applicant may choose which of these
options to meet from a flexible, point-based menu. All buildings subject to this section
must reach a minimum number of points, with additional points required for certain
building types (e.g., buildings with trademarked design features, large buildings
or long façades, and buildings using a large percentage of certain building materials.)

Article 4 includes standards and incentives for Mixed Use development. This Article
includes descriptions and standards for the Mixed Use Combining District and the Vertical
Mixed Use Overlay District. This Article also includes standards and incentives for
the development of Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) buildings.

Article 5 includes Definitions for terms used in this Subchapter.

This Subchapter generally addresses the physical relationship between commercial and
other nonresidential development and adjacent properties, public streets, neighborhoods,
and the natural environment, in order to implement the City Council's vision for a
more attractive, efficient, and livable community. The general purposes of this Subchapter
include:

1.1.1.

To provide appropriate standards to ensure a high quality appearance for Austin and
promote pedestrian-friendly design while also allowing flexibility, individuality,
creativity, and artistic expression;

1.1.2.

To strengthen and protect the image, identity, and unique character of Austin and
thereby to enhance its business economy;

1.1.3.

To protect and enhance residential neighborhoods, commercial districts, and other
areas by encouraging physical development that is of high quality and is compatible
with the character, scale, and function of its surrounding area;

1.1.4.

To encourage developments that relate well to adjoining public streets, open spaces,
and neighborhoods; and

1.1.5.

To provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible
mix of residential and nonresidential uses within close proximity to each other, rather
than separating uses.

Source: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.

1.4.1.
  Purpose and Scope.

"Minor modifications" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of
this Subchapter that may be approved by the Director in order to protect natural or
historic features or to address unusual site conditions. Minor modifications are to
be used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood
of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary
to complete a formal variance process.

1.4.2.
  Applicability.

The Director may approve minor modifications of any numeric development standard in
this Subchapter up to a maximum of ten percent (or up to a maximum of 20 percent to
protect an existing natural site feature), provided that the applicable criteria in
Section 1.4.4 (Approval Criteria) are met.

For a Heritage Tree, the Director may approve modification of any numeric development
standard in this Subchapter to the minimum extent required to preserve the Heritage
Tree.

A modified development standard is calculated by applying the percentage of modification
allowed by the Director to the numeric requirement that would otherwise apply if the
development standard was not modified. For example, if a building façade is required
to have 40% glazing, which would equal 400 square feet glazing on a 1000-square foot
façade, then a 10% minor modification would decrease the amount of required glazing
by 40 square feet for a total of 360 square feet of required glazing. The minor modification
process may be used only to authorize a less restrictive standard and may not be used
to impose a standard on the subject property than is higher than otherwise provided
in this Subchapter. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a minor modification
that results in:

A.

An increase in overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover;

B.

A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;

C.

A change in the requirements of any of the following provisions:

1.

Subchapter C, Article 3 (Additional Requirements for Certain Districts);

2.

Subchapter C, Article 4 (Additional Requirements for Certain Uses);

3.

Subchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards); or

D.

A change in conditions attached to a subdivision plan, site plan, special use permit,
or restrictive covenant approved by the City.

1.4.3.
  Procedure.

The Director may initiate or approve a minor modification allowed under this section
at any time prior to submittal of the staff report on the application to another decision-making
body or prior to final decision if the Director is the final decision-maker. The Director
shall specify any approved minor modifications and the justifications for such modifications
on the pending development application for which the modifications were sought.

1.4.4.
  Approval Criteria.

The Director may approve a minor modification from the terms of this Subchapter only
upon finding that the modification meets all of the criteria below:

A.

The requested modification is in general conformity with the stated purposes of this
Subchapter;

B.

The requested modification meets all other applicable zoning, building, drainage,
water quality, and safety code requirements;

C.

The requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health,
safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the general public, or
such impacts will be substantially mitigated; and

D.

The requested modification is necessary to compensate for some practical difficulty
or some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development not shared by landowners
in general.

1.5.1.
  Purpose and Scope.

To encourage creative and original design, and to accommodate projects where the particular
site conditions or the proposed use prevent strict compliance with this Subchapter,
alternative equivalent compliance allows development to occur in a manner that meets
the intent of this Subchapter, yet through an alternative design that does not strictly
adhere to the Subchapter's standards. The procedure is not a general waiver of regulations.
Alternative equivalent compliance shall not be used when the desired departure from
the standards of this Subchapter could be achieved using the minor modification process
in Section 1.4.

1.5.2.
  Applicability.

The alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following
sections of this Subchapter:

A.

Section 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways;

B.

Section 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites;

C.

Section 2.5, Exterior Lighting;

D.

Section 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities;

E.

Section 2.8, Shade and Shelter; and

F.

Article 3, Building Design Standards.

1.5.3.
  Procedure.

The applicant may select at his or her discretion whether to seek an informal recommendation
or a formal approval on a proposal for alternative compliance.

A.

Option One: Informal Recommendation.

1.

Pre-Application Conference Required. If an applicant desires only an informal response and recommendation as to a proposal
for alternative compliance, he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference
prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.
At the conference, the applicant shall provide a written summary of the project and
the proposed alternative compliance, and the Director shall offer an informal, non-binding
response and recommendation regarding the appropriateness of the proposed alternative.
Based on that response, the applicant may prepare a site plan and/or building permit
application that proposes alternative compliance, and such application shall include
sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the
alternative compliance requested.

2.

Decision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be
the responsibility of the decision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application.
The final decision-making body for site plans is either the Director or the appropriate
Land Use Commission, as specified in Chapter 25-5, and the building official for building permits.

3.

Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection
the Director shall review the concept plan for compliance with the criteria in Section
1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.

B.

Option Two: Formal Decision.

1.

Pre-Application Conference. If an applicant desires formal approval of a proposal for alternative compliance,
he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting
the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.

2.

Alternative Compliance Concept Plan Required. At least ten days prior to the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit
an alternative compliance concept plan application to the Director, which shall include:

a.

A written description of and justification for the proposed alternative method of
compliance, specifically addressing the criteria in Section 1.5.4.; and

b.

A concept plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, the
intended locations and quantities of proposed buildings on the site, the layout of
proposed vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation systems, and areas designated
to meet requirements for open space, parking, on-site amenities, utilities, and landscape.
The concept plan shall describe the site's topography and shall provide a general
description of environmental characteristics to assist in determining compliance with
this Subchapter. If alternative compliance is requested from the standards of Article
3, Building Design, the concept plan also shall include descriptions and illustrations
of the proposed building design elements that would not comply with the standards
of this Subchapter.

3.

Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection
the Director shall review the concept plan for compliance with the criteria in Section
1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.

4.

Expiration of Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.

a.

An approved alternative compliance concept plan shall expire if three years pass following
its approval and no building permit that implements the concept plan has been issued.

b.

One, one-year extension may be issued by the Director provided that a written request
has been received prior to the expiration of the concept plan, and the Director has
determined that no major changes in the city's development standards, or changes in
the development pattern of the surrounding properties, have occurred.

5.

Effect of Approval. Written approval of an alternative compliance concept plan does not authorize any
development activity, but rather authorizes the applicant to prepare a site plan and/or
building permit application that incorporates the approved alternative compliance,
and authorizes the decision-making body (either the Land Use Commission or the Director
for site plans, and the building official for building permits) to review the site
plan and/or building permit application for compliance with the alternative compliance
concept plan, in addition to all other applicable requirements. The site plan and/or
building permit application shall include a copy of the approved alternative compliance
concept plan.

6.

Amendments to Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.

a.

Minor amendments to any approved alternative compliance concept plan may be approved,
approved with conditions, or denied administratively by the Director. For purposes
of this provision, minor amendments are those that do not result in:

(i)

An increase of 10 percent or more in the amount of square footage of a land use or
structure;

(ii)

A change in the types of uses in the project;

(iii)

An increase or decrease of 20 percent or more in the number of dwelling units in the
project; or

(iv)

A change that would bring the project out of compliance with any requirement or regulation
set forth in the City Code outside this Subchapter unless a variance to or waiver
from such requirement or regulation is obtained.

b.

Amendments that are not determined by the Director to be minor amendments under subsection
a. above shall be deemed major amendments. The applicant may seek approval of a major
amendment by re-submitting the original approved plan along with the proposed amendment
to the Director for review in the same manner prescribed in subsection B.2. above.

c.

If any site plan and/or building permit application includes a major amendment from
the terms of the approved concept plan that has not been approved by the Director,
the concept plan shall be void and the application shall be reviewed for compliance
with the standards of this Subchapter and all other applicable requirements.

1.5.4.
  Criteria.

Alternative equivalent compliance may be approved only if the applicant demonstrates
that the following criteria have been met:

A.

The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter
from which the alternative is sought; or

B.

The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter
from which the alternative is sought to the maximum extent practicable and is necessary
because:

1.

Physical characteristics unique to the subject site (such as, but not limited to,
slopes, size, shape, and vegetation) make strict compliance with the subject standard
impracticable or unreasonable;

2.

Physical design characteristics unique to the proposed use or type of use make strict
compliance with the subject standard impracticable or unreasonable; or

3.

An undue financial hardship would be created for a development less than 10,000 square
feet without any exterior trademark design feature.

1.5.5.
  Effect of Approval.

Alternative compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested
and shall not establish a precedent for approval of other requests.

2.2.1.
  Overview of Roadway Types.

A.

Purpose. In this Subchapter, roadway types are used as an organizing tool for certain development
standards. In this Section 2.2., sidewalk, building placement, and streetscape standards
and building entryway location are determined by the roadway type that is adjacent
to the site. The following five roadway types are listed from highest to lowest priority
for purposes of this Subchapter (See Figures 3 - 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached
to Ord. 20130606-088):

1.

Core Transit Corridor;

2.

Internal Circulation Route;

3.

Urban Roadway;

4.

Suburban Roadway; and

5.

Highway or Hill Country Roadway.

B.

Applicability. The roadway with the highest level of priority adjacent to the lot or site is considered
the "principal street" for purposes of this Subchapter. For a lot or site that is
adjacent to more than one roadway of equal priority, the development shall be subject
to the standards associated with the roadway with the highest level of transit service,
as determined by the Director, or if the roadways do not have transit service or the
level of transit service is equal, the roadway designated by the lot owner.

For large sites subject to Section 2.2.5. or for sites abutting more than one roadway
type, the Sidewalk and Supplemental Zone requirements (but not the Building Placement
and Parking requirements) shall apply along all abutting streets or Internal Circulation
Route frontages, with the applicable requirements determined by the roadway type.

2.2.2.
  Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement.

A.

Applicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:

| Standard | Applies if the Principal Street Is: | Applies to the Following: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.2.2. Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement | Core Transit Corridor | - All zoning districts   - Single-family residential uses are exempt, in addition to the general exemptions in Section 1.2.4. |

(See Figure 3 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of a Core Transit Corridor
(South Congress)

(See Figure 4 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of an Internal Circulation
Route (Midtown Commons)

(See Figure 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of Highway (1-35)

B.

Sidewalks. In order to create an environment that is supportive of pedestrian and transit mobility,
public sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all Core Transit Corridors in
accordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is
required for all sites with frontage along a Core Transit Corridor regardless of principal
street designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on
one side of a street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite
side of the street or right-of-way. A development that complies with the Great Streets
standards adopted by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt
from the requirements of this section and may seek any reimbursements available under
the Great Streets Development program.

For development that is subject to the requirements of this section, no sidewalk shall
be less than 15 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part of the Alternative
Equivalent Compliance process. The 15-foot minimum requirement shall apply regardless
of the available right-of-way. Where required, the sidewalk shall extend onto private
property to fulfill the 15-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk easement provided.

Sidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb,
and a clear zone. (See Figures 6 - 9.) The following standards shall apply to these
zones:

(See Figure 6 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor sidewalk
requirements. Street trees are required along core transit corridors with an average
spacing not greater than 30 feet on center.)

(See Figure 7 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with
underground utilities)

(See Figure 8 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with
overhead utility zone)

(See Figure 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with
overhead utility zone at curb)

1.

Planting Zone.

a.

The planting zone shall have a minimum width of eight feet (from face of curb) and
shall be continuous and located adjacent to the curb.

b.

The zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than
30 feet on center. The director shall adopt a list of acceptable street trees for
purposes of this section. The list shall emphasize shade trees; however, alternative
trees may only be approved (pursuant to Section 2.2.2.B.3. below) where conflicts
may arise because of overhead utility lines.

c.

In addition, the zone is intended for the placement of street furniture including
seating, street lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper
vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric
transformers and water meters, and similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct
pedestrian access or motorist visibility.

2.

Clear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of seven feet, shall be hardscaped, shall
be located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall comply with ADA and Texas Accessibility
Standards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent element
for a minimum width of seven feet and a minimum height of eight feet.

3.

Utilities.

a.

All utility lines shall be underground from the building to the property line. Utility
lines within the right-of-way shall be placed underground or relocated to the rear
of the site to the maximum extent practicable.

b.

Where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, an overhead
utility zone shall be provided so that no portion of the building is located within
a 10-foot radius of the energized conductor. This overhead utility zone shall be in
addition to the minimum planting zone, clear zone, and supplemental zone (if provided).
Options for street tree planting and sidewalk placement in combination with overhead
utilities are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.

(See Figures 8 and 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088)

c.

On lots with a depth of 120 feet or less and where electric utilities remain overhead
and are located behind the curb, alternative trees from the list identified in Section
2.2.2.B.1.b. above may be used so that the trees can be located beneath, rather than
offset from, the overhead electric utilities.

4.

Alternative Requirements For Shallow Lots. On lots with a depth of 150 feet or less, the total sidewalk may be reduced to 12
feet, consisting of a seven-foot minimum planting zone and a five-foot clear zone.

C.

Supplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided at the option of the applicant between the street-facing
façade line and the required clear zone. (See Figures 10 - 11.) The following standards
apply to supplemental zones:

(See Figures 10 and 11 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Optional supplemental zone
may be expanded to 30 feet for a maximum of 30 percent of the frontage.)

1.

If a supplemental zone is provided, up to 30 percent of the linear frontage of the
supplemental zone may be a maximum of 30 feet wide, and the remainder of the supplemental
zone shall be a maximum of 20 feet wide. (See Figures 10 - 11.)

2.

Elements that support active public uses can and should be located Within the supplemental
zone, including one or more of the following:

a.

Accessory outdoor dining, provided that the dining area may be separated from the
sidewalk only with planters, shrubs, or fencing with a maximum height of 42 inches
(See Figure 12.);

(See Figure 12 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of supplemental zone
with outdoor dining.)

b.

Balconies, pedestrian walkways, porches, handicap ramps, and stoops; provided, however,
that no such feature shall extend beyond the supplemental zone without a license agreement;

c.

Terraces, provided that they have a maximum finished floor height of 24 inches above
the sidewalk elevation and shall be surrounded by a guardrail that meets city specifications;

d.

Landscape and water features;

e.

Plazas; and

f.

Incidental display and sales.

3.

Other improvements that support active uses as approved by the Director.

4.

Any features in the supplemental zone must not obstruct the open pedestrian connection
between the building's primary entrance and the clear zone.

5.

A Transit Plaza adjacent to a Capital Metro, MetroRapid Station.

D.

Building Placement.

1.

General Building Placement Standard. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at
least 75 percent of the net frontage length of the property along the Core Transit
Corridor must consist of continuous building façade built up to the clear zone, or
the supplemental zone if one is provided. (See Figure 13.) For purposes of this Subchapter,
"net frontage length" is defined in Article 5. This minimum net frontage length requirement
shall not apply if the site qualifies for one of the exceptions in this subsection.

(See Figure 13 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of permitted building
placement along Core Transit Corridors. Parking is not permitted in the hatched area
between the street-facing façade and the sidewalk.)

2.

Exception: Civic Buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a distinctive architectural statement,
civic buildings, as defined in Article 5, do not have to be built up to the clear
zone (or supplemental zone if one is provided), so long as parking is not located
between the building frontage facing the principal street and the street. (See Figure
14.)

(See Figure 14 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; The Austin City Hall is set
back from the street in some areas, while other non civic buildings meet the street.
This is a traditional urban design technique intended to emphasize the importance
of civic uses.)

3.

Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in
or drive-through building may include a circulation lane of up to 20 feet in width
between the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public
roadway. The drive-in or drive-through building located behind the circulation lane
need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking
and must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation
aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal entrance. (See Figure
15.)

(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced
by a single curb cut do not have to meet the building placement standards in order
to allow for a circulation lane.)

4.

Exception: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of
this building placement standard through the alternative equivalent compliance procedure
in Section 1.5 because there will not be enough building frontage to meet the 75 percent
net frontage length requirement, the Director may approve an alternative design provided
one of the following is met, in addition to the criteria in Section 1.5.4.:

a.

On a site with a single principal building:

(i)

The longer side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental
zone if provided) (See Figure 16.), or

(ii)

At least one side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental
zone if provided) and the majority of the tenant spaces must have principal entrances
facing the principal street (See Figure 17.)

(See Figures 16 and 17 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Alternative building placement
options.)

b.

On a site with more than one principal building, at least one building must be built
to the clear zone (or supplemental zone), and:

(i)

The longer side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the principal
street, must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided), or

(ii)

At least one side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the
principal street, must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided)
and the majority of tenant spaces in any such building must have principal entrances
facing the principal street.

5.

Exemption for Restaurant or Service Station Redevelopment. The building placement standards in this subsection do not apply to the redevelopment
of an existing pad site restaurant or service station use by the owner or buyer if:

a.

the use proposed is a restaurant or service station;

b.

the redevelopment occurs within the existing site configuration:

c.

sidewalks are provided in compliance with this section.

6.

Exception: Small Interior Lots. Development on interior lots with 65 feet or less of frontage on the principal street
and with vehicular access only from the principal street is exempt from the building
placement standards of this subsection.

E.

Off-Street Parking.

1.

Off-street parking is prohibited between the Core Transit Corridor and the corresponding
street-facing façade line. (See Figure 18.)

(See Figure 18 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking to the side of a building
is permitted but screening is required between the parking and the sidewalk. No parking
is permitted between the building and the sidewalk on a Core Transit Corridor.)

2.

Any off-street surface parking along a Core Transit Corridor shall have landscape
buffering in accord with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC between the clear zone (or the supplemental zone if provided) and the
parking area. The buffering method chosen must include shade trees.

B.

Public sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all Urban Roadways in accordance
with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is required for
all sites with frontage along an Urban Roadway regardless of principal street designation
or building placement requirements, but a development located on one side of a street
or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite side of the street
or right-of-way. A development that complies with the Great Streets standards adopted
by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt from the requirements
of this section and may seek any reimbursements available under the Great Streets
Development program.

For development that is subject to the requirements of this section, sidewalks shall
be no less than 12 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part of the Alternative
Equivalent Compliance process. (See Figure 19.) The 12-foot minimum requirement shall
apply regardless of the available right-of-way. Where required, the sidewalk shall
extend onto private property to fulfill the 12-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk
easement provided.

(See Figure 19 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Urban roadway sidewalk width
requirements. Note that street trees are optional on urban roadways.)

Sidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb,
and a clear zone. The following standards apply:

1.

Planting Zone. The planting zone shall have a minimum width of seven feet and shall be continuous
and located adjacent to the curb. In addition, the planting zone is intended for the
placement of street furniture including seating, street lights, waste receptacles,
fire hydrants, traffic signs, newspaper vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks,
public utility equipment such as electric transformers and water meters, and similar
elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility.

C.

Supplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided, at the applicant's option, between the street-facing
façade line and the required clear zone. If provided, the supplemental zone shall
be a maximum of 20 feet wide and shall comply with the standards above in Section
2.2.2.C. (See Figure 23.)

(See Figure 23 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Urban Roadway with optional
supplemental zone.)

D.

Building Placement.

1.

Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at
least 40 percent of the net frontage length along the Urban Roadway must consist of
continuous building façade built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided).
(See Figure 24.) Net frontage length is defined in Article 5.

(See Figure 24 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of building placement
on Urban Roadways. Parking is generally not permitted in the hatched area between
the building façade and the sidewalk, except for shallow lots, as described in paragraph
D.)

2.

Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation
lane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only
one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-through building located
behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation
lane may not have parking and must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway
that crosses the circulation aisle and connects to the clear zone to the building's
principal entrance. (See Figure 15.)

(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced
by a single curb cut do not have to meet the building placement standards in order
to allow for a circulation lane.)

3.

Exception: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of this building placement standard through
the alternative equivalent compliance procedure in Section 1.5 because there will
not be enough building frontage to meet the 40 percent net frontage length requirement,
the Director may approve an alternative design provided one of the standards in Section
2.2.2.D.4. is met, in addition to the criteria in Section 1.5.4.

4.

Exception: Restaurant or Service Station Redevelopment. The building placement standards in this subsection do not apply to the redevelopment
of an existing pad site restaurant or service station use by the owner if:

a.

the use proposed is a restaurant or service station;

b.

the redevelopment occurs within the existing site configuration;

c.

the sidewalks are provided in compliance with this section.

5.

Exception: Small Interior Lots. Development on interior lots with 65 feet or less of frontage on the principal street
and with vehicular access only from the principal street is exempt from the building
placement standards of this subsection.

E.

Parking. Parking is prohibited between the building(s) and the property line adjacent to the
Urban Roadway. However, on sites 400 feet deep or less, parking may be located between
the street-facing façade line and the Urban Roadway if:

1.

At least 60 percent of the property's net frontage length along the Urban Roadway
consists of continuous building façade (divided into no more than two buildings) (see
Figure 25), or 40 percent of the net frontage length consists of continuous vertical
mixed use building façade (divided into no more than two buildings), built up to the
clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided); and

(See Figure 25 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking is permitted between
the building and the roadway on shallow lots less than 400 feet deep, when certain
conditions are met.)

2.

Any surface parking along an Urban Roadway shall have landscape buffering in accord
with Section 252-1006 of the LDC between the clear zone (or the supplemental zone
if provided) and the parking area; and

3.

A sidewalk, 4 minimum width, planted with trees at an average spacing not greater
than 30 on center or 4 awning, leads to the main customer entrance from the clear
zone (or supplemental zone if provided). No more than one drive aisle can cross the
sidewalk. For multi-tenant developments, there must be a shaded sidewalk to the street-facing
building façade at least every 330 feet of Urban Roadway frontage. (See Figure 26.)

(See Figure 26 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of shaded sidewalks.)

F.

Corner Sites. All sites located on a corner and adjacent to at least one Urban Roadway shall comply
with the corner-site standards in Section 2.2.4.E.

2.2.4.
  Suburban Roadways: Sidewalks and Building Placement.

A.

Applicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:

| Standard | Applies if the Principal Street Is: | Applies to the Following: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.2.4. Suburban Roadways: Sidewalks and Building Placement | Suburban Roadway | All non-residential zoning districts (development of any site subject to the internal circulation system requirements in Section 2.2.5.) |

B.

Sidewalks. Public sidewalks shall be located along both sides of all Suburban Roadways
in accordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section
is required for all sites with frontage along an Suburban Roadway regardless of principal
street designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on
one side of a street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite
side of the street or right-of-way. Sidewalks and supplemental zones shall comply
with the standards for sidewalks along Urban Roadways in Section 2.2.3. above.

C.

Building Placement.

1.

On Suburban Roadways, parking is discouraged between the building and the street.
(See Figure 27.) If the property meets the building placement requirements for Urban
Roadways as set forth in Section 2.2.3.D. above and no parking is located between
the principal street and any street-facing building elevation, the project is exempt
from the connectivity requirements in Section 2.3.1.

(See Figure 27 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking is discouraged between
the building and the street on Suburban Roadways.)

2.

Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation
lane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only
one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-through building located
behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation
lane may not have parking and must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway
that crosses the circulation aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal
entrance. (See Figure 15.)

(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced
by a single curb cut do not have to meet the building placement standards in order
to allow for a circulation lane.)

D.

Parking. Parking along the street frontage must have:

1.

Landscape buffering in accordance with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC; and

2.

A sidewalk, planted with trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 on center,
leading to the main customer entrance from the property line. No more than two drive
aisles may cross the sidewalk. For multi-tenant developments, there must be a shaded
sidewalk for at least every 330 feet of frontage along the suburban roadway frontage.

E.

Corner Sites. For sites located on a corner on Suburban Roadways:

1.

Surface parking is prohibited within the rectangular area formed by the setback lines
as measured 100 feet back from the curb line corners (or the intersection of the curb

Hill Country Roadway to be divided in a manner inconsistent with Chapter 25-6, Article 6, Division 2 (Access to Hill Country Roadways) or state highway access spacing requirements.

3.

Subdivision of Internal Blocks. Internal blocks abutting Internal Circulation Routes may be subdivided to allow for
the sale and development of individual blocks without frontage on a public street
if the Director determines that the Internal Circulation Routes are equivalent to
a public street in terms of utilities, pavement design, and vehicle access requirements.
For the purpose of compliance with setback and minimum lot frontage requirements,
an Internal Circulation Route is considered equivalent to a public street.

D.

right-of-way, subdivision boundary lines, or natural features if no reasonable alternatives
are available.

c.

Revisions to the Project Circulation Plan may be approved by the Director after considering
the circulation characteristics of a proposed development plan, the need for access
to adjoining properties, and the compatibility of surrounding development.

d.

The Director may waive the requirement for a Project Circulation Plan if the Director
finds that a plan is not necessary due to the nature of the proposed development on
the site, the existence of surrounding incompatible development, or other factors
unique to the property which make strict compliance infeasible.

E.

Sidewalks.

1.

Sidewalk Requirements.

a.

Publicly accessible sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all Internal Circulation
Routes (whether built as public streets or as private drives) unless:

(i)

and other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the building
and landscape so that the visual impacts of these functions are fully contained and
out of view from adjacent properties and public streets. Screening materials for solid
waste collection and loading areas shall be the same as, or of equal quality to, the
materials used for the principal building. In the downtown, loading docks, truck parking,
outdoor storage, trash collection, trash compaction, and other service functions may
be placed alongside public alleys without the necessity of screening.

Source: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.

2.7.1.
  Purpose.

Open air and semi-enclosed public gathering spaces can act as central organizing elements
in a large development. They can also help to shape the relationship between different
land uses and provide focal points and anchors for pedestrian activity. Goals and
requirements for common open space and pedestrian amenities complement the Austin
Code's requirements for dedicated public open space and parks, and serve similar purposes.

2.7.2.
  Applicability.

The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:

| Standard | Applies if the Principal Street Is: | Applies to the Following: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.7. Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities | All roadway types | All site plans two acres in size or larger, and all multifamily and condominium uses except as provided in 25-2-776 and 25-2-780 |

2.7.3.
  Standards.

A.

Amenity Required. All development subject to this section shall devote a minimum of five percent of
the gross site area to one or more of the following types of private common open space
or pedestrian amenities:

1.

A natural and undeveloped private common open space, for use of the residents, employees,
and visitors to the development.

2.

A landscape area other than one required by Subchapter C, Article 9 (Landscaping),
provided such landscaped area has a minimum depth and width of 20 feet and a minimum
total area of 650 square feet. The area shall include pedestrian amenities.

3.

A patio or plaza with outdoor seating areas, provided the patio or plaza has a minimum
depth and width of 20 feet and a minimum total area of 650 square feet. The area shall
include pedestrian amenities including fully or partially shaded spaces with flexible
or permanent seating to support these places as gathering areas.

4.

A play area with amenities or equipment suitable for children under nine years of
age, provided the play area has a minimum depth and width of 20 feet and a minimum
total area of 650 square feet. Play areas shall comply with the most current Consumer
Product Safety Commission guidelines for playgrounds as well as ASTM International
standards as applicable and shall have impediments between the activity area and any
nearby vehicular drives or parking areas to minimize the opportunities for young children
to wander into traffic. Such impediments may include berms, fencing, landscaping or
other barriers as appropriate to the site and which meet safety standards. Play areas
shall include partially-shaded areas with flexible or permanent seating for adult
supervision. A project which chooses this option may reduce the total amount of open
space required by 10 percent.

5.

10.

A transit plaza, on private property, that is adjacent to a Capital Metro MetroRapid
stop or station.

11.

A combination of the above-listed amenities. (See Figure 36.)

(See Figure 36 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of open space amenities.)

B.

Location Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets
exist on a property, the developer shall give priority to their preservation as private
common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space
areas, the Director shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine
whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with
priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular
order):

1.

Wetlands;

2.

Flood hazard areas;

3.

Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors;

4.

Tree preservation areas (See Figure 37.);

(See Figure 37 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of tree preservation
during construction.)

5.

Karst areas;

6.

Cultural or historically significant structures, landscapes, features, and/or places;
and

7.

Agricultural lands used for cultivation of local produce.

Where private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist
or are proposed in the City of Austin Trails Master Plan, Austin Parks and Recreation
Long-Range Plan, Sidewalk Master Plan, or Bicycle Plan within or adjacent to the tract
to be subdivided or developed, the private common open space or pedestrian amenity
shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the
presently existing or proposed trail, park, or other open area land. Public access
easements may be required in order to guarantee public access to these facilities.

Where there is a BRT station adjacent to the tract to be developed, a portion of the
private common open space or pedestrian amenity shall, to the maximum extent feasible,
be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing or permitted station.
For sites greater than one acre, the open space should be a minimum of 150 s.f. plus
an additional 100 s.f. per acre over one, not to exceed 1,000 s.f. This will apply
only outside the Central Business District (CBD) and downtown-mixed-use (DMU) zoning.

C.

Areas Not Credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards private common open
space or pedestrian amenities required by this section:

1.

Open space in a required street yard;

2.

Public or private streets or rights of way;

3.

Off-street parking, loading areas, driveways, and service areas; and

4.

Water quality and storm water detention ponds, unless designed as an accessible amenity
and approved by the Director.

D.

Design Criteria. Land set aside for private common open space or pedestrian amenities pursuant to
this section shall meet the following design criteria, as relevant:

1.

Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable
by residents or visitors in various locations of the development, unless the lands
are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted.

2.

Open space areas shall be compact and contiguous unless the open space is used as
a continuation of an existing trail, or specific or unique topographic features that
are adjacent or adjoining require a different configuration. An example of such topographic
features would be the provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor.

3.

The surface of a required open space must be suitable for outdoor activities. A surface
must consist of lawn, garden, flagstone, wood planking, concrete, or other serviceable,
dust free material. Asphalt or similar surfacing may be used for designated recreation
areas such as multi-purpose trails, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Decomposed
granite may be used if approved by the Director and if accessibility requirements
are met. A combination of different materials is encouraged.

4.

Except as provided in this subsection, not more than 30 percent of the required open
space may be located on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level. In determining
the amount of open space on a roof, an area occupied by a vent, mechanical equipment
or structure that does not enhance the usability of the space is excluded.

5.

Up to 50 percent of the required private common open space may be located on a roof,
balcony, or other area above ground level if at least 50 percent of the open space
above ground level is designed as a Vegetated or Green Roof. For the purpose of this
section, a Vegetated or Green Roof is an assembly or system, over an occupied space,
that supports an area of planted bed(s), built up on a waterproofed surface at any
level that is contained separately from the natural ground by a human-made structure.
A Vegetated or Green Roof must comply with the performance standards adopted by rule.

6.

Private common open space on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level must
be screened from the view of adjacent property that is in an urban residence (SF-5)
or more restrictive zoning district, in accordance with the standards in Section 25-2-1066
(Screening Requirements).

7.

A project which allows public access during normal business hours to a private common
open space above ground level may reduce the total amount of open space required by
10 percent.

8.

This subsection provides for the covering of a required open space.

(a.)

Not more than 50 percent of ground level open space may be covered by a fixed manmade
obstruction, including a roof, balcony, or building projection. Roof gardens and sculptural
elements that are accessible to the public are not to be considered manmade obstructions.

(b.)

Open space above ground level may be covered, but must have at least one exterior
side open and unobstructed, except for railings or balustrades.

9.

In VMU and V zoning districts, streetscape improvements within the public right-of-way
may be included in the calculation of open space except for the area within the Clear
Zone as defined in this Subchapter. This provision does not apply to streetscape projects
for which the City participates in the cost of the improvements or which are required
to be constructed as a condition of CURE zoning.

E.

Maintenance. All private common open space or pedestrian amenity areas shall be permanently maintained
by the owners of the development.

F.

Fee In Lieu.

1.

Instead of providing private common open space or pedestrian amenities as required
in this section, the developer of a property located within the urban roadways boundary
(as defined in Article 5 of this Subchapter) may request approval to deposit with
the city a nonrefundable cash payment to be used for the acquisition or improvement
of open space that will serve residents of the development.

2.

The criteria for approving payment of a fee and the formula for calculating the fee
amount shall be adopted by the city council, with a recommendation from the Director.

3.

The Director shall review a request for payment of a fee based on the adopted criteria
and accept or deny the request no later than 15 days following its receipt.

is provided under the requirements of this Subchapter:

1.

40 percent of the wall area below ten feet as measured from the finish floor level
of this façade's entry shall consist of glazing unless topography, distance or other
physical characteristics remove the façade from a close physical connection to the
roadway or Internal Circulation Route (See Figure 39.); and

(See Figure 39 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Glazing and façade relief requirements)

2.

25 percent of the wall area between ten feet and thirty feet as measured from the
finish floor level of this façade's entry shall consist of glazing. (See Figure 39.)

B.

One façade shall be exempt from glazing and façade relief requirements. The exempt
façade cannot face a public street or Internal Circulation Route.

C.

On all other façades, at least 25 percent of the wall area between two and ten feet
as measured from the finish floor level of this façade's entry must consist of glazing
or façade relief unless vegetative screening, which must be evergreen, is allowed
if approved by the Director, and may not be used as glazing option on front-facing
façade.

D.

Any façade that is built up to an interior mid-block property line is not required
to have glazing on that façade if no prohibitions and no contractual or legal impediments
exist that would prevent a building being constructed on the adjacent property up
to the wall of the façade.

E.

At least one-half of the total area of all glazing on façades that face the principal
street shall have a Visible Transmittance (VT) of 0.6 or higher.

F.

The requirements in this section may be reduced to the extent that the required level
or location of glazing conflicts with the standards of the Adopted Energy Code, Building
Code, LEED, or the Green Building Program.

This Article 4 is intended to provide for and encourage development and redevelopment
that contains a compatible mix of residential, commercial, and institutional uses
within close proximity to each other, rather than separating uses. The mixed use provisions
define the uses of land and the siting and character of the improvements and structures
allowed on the land in a manner that encourages a balanced and sustainable mix of
uses. They promote an efficient pedestrian-access network that connects the nonresidential
and residential uses and transit facilities. Redevelopment of underutilized parcels
and infill development of vacant parcels should foster pedestrian-oriented residential
and mixed use development. (See Figure 45.)

(See Figure 45 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of vertical mixed
use)

| COMMENTARY: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTIN GENERALLY |
| The City of Austin allows and encourages the development of mixed use projects. Mixed use development integrates two or more land uses, such as residential and commercial, with a strong pedestrian orientation. Requirements and standards for mixed use development appear in various places throughout the Austin City Code. |
| Zoning Districts in which Mixed Use is Allowed and Encouraged |
| The following districts are intended primarily for mixed use development and are described more fully in Section 4.2 below: |
| • Mixed Use Combining District (Section 4.2.1.). |
| • Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District (Section 4.2.2.). |
| Mixed use development also is allowed in other Austin zoning districts. Some of these districts are listed below and are described more fully in the referenced sections of the Austin Code. This list is not exhaustive, but rather is intended to illustrate the range of districts in which mixed use development is allowed. |
| • Central Business (CBD) (Section 25-2-100); |
| • Central Urban Redevelopment (CURE) (Section 25-2-163); |
| • Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) (Section 25-2-101); |
| • Planned Development Area (PDA) (Section 25-2-174); |
| • Planned Unit Development (Section 25-2-144); |
| • Traditional Neighborhood Development (Section 25-2-146); |
| • Transit Oriented Development (Section 25-2-147); |
| • Waterfront Overlay (WO) (Section 25-2-175); and |
| • University Neighborhood Overlay (UNO) (Section 25-2-178). |
| Types of Mixed Use Development |
| Within the districts that allow mixed use development, uses may be combined either vertically in the same building, or horizontally in multiple buildings, or through a combination of the two, depending on the standards of the district. |
| Vertical mixed use is allowed in two building types: the Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) Building and the Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) Building. Standards for VMU buildings are in Section 4.3. below, and standards for NMU buildings are in Subchapter D, Article 6. |
| Horizontal mixed use is the mixing of uses in a development project, though not necessarily in the same building. Horizontal mixed use is allowed and encouraged in Austin so long as each of the proposed uses is allowed within the applicable zoning district and the development meets all applicable requirements of the Austin Code. |

A VMU building shall meet the following requirements:

A.

Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing any application for a development that will contain a VMU building,
the developer shall request in writing a pre-application conference with the Director.
The purpose of a pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for an informal
evaluation of the applicant's proposal and to familiarize the applicant and the city
staff with the applicable provisions of this Subchapter such as the VMU affordability
requirements, and other issues that may affect the applicant's proposal (e.g., accessibility
requirements). The informal evaluation of the Director and staff provided at the conference
are not binding upon the applicant or the city, but are intended to serve as a guide
to the applicant in making the application.

B.

Mix of Uses. A use on the ground floor must be different from a use on an upper floor. The second
floor may be designed to have the same use as the ground floor so long as there is
at least one more floor above the second floor that has a different use from the first
two floors. At least one of the floors shall contain residential dwelling units. (See
Figure 46.)

(See Figure 46 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples (not a comprehensive
list) of use mixes that would meet these requirements.)

C.

Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial Spaces. Along at least 75 percent of the building frontage along the principal street, the
building must be designed for commercial uses in ground-floor spaces that meet the
following standards. A lobby serving another use in the VMU building shall not count

Dimensional Requirements.

1.

VMU buildings are subject to the height restrictions as provided in other sections
of this Code.

2.

Except as provided in Section 4.3.5., a VMU building that meets the affordability
requirements in subsection F. below is not subject to certain dimensional standards
applicable in the base zoning district. These standards include the following:

a.

Minimum site area requirements (if applicable);

b.

Maximum floor area ratio;

c.

Maximum building coverage;

d.

Minimum street side yard setback and interior yard setback; and

e.

Minimum front yard setback; provided, however, that if the right-of-way is less than
60 feet in width, the minimum front yard setback for buildings three or more stories
in height shall be 30 feet from the centerline of the street to ensure adequate Fire
Department access.

3.

For all uses in a VMU building, the minimum off-street parking requirement shall be
60 percent of that prescribed by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading
Requirements). This reduction may not be used in combination with any other parking
reduction. Only the parking requirements for commercial uses are subject to modification
through the opt-in/opt-out process in Section 4.3.5.

F.

Affordability Requirements. To be eligible for the dimensional or parking standards exemption in Subsection E
of this section, the residential units in a VMU building shall meet the following
affordability requirements, which shall run with the land. This ordinance does not
amend or repeal graphics or pictures that are used to illustrate various code requirements
in the published version of Chapter 25-2, Subchapter E (Design Standards and Mixed Use).

1.

Affordability Requirements for Owner-Occupied Units.

a.

Five percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved as affordable,
for not less than 99 years from the date a certificate of occupancy is issued, for
ownership and occupancy by households earning no more than 80 percent of the current
Annual Median Family Income for the City of Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area as
determined by the Director of Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department.

b.

In addition, five percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved,
for not less than 99 years from the date a certificate of occupancy is issued, for
ownership and occupancy by households earning no more than 100 percent of the Annual
Median Family Income.

c.

The City in its sole discretion may elect to subsidize an additional ten percent of
the for-sale residential units in the building, at an affordability level consistent
with criteria and procedures established by the Director.

2.

Affordability Requirements for Rental Units.

a.

Ten percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved as affordable,
for a minimum of 40 years following the issuance of the certificate of occupancy,
for rental by households earning no more than 80 percent of the Annual Median Family
Income.

b.

As part of the one-time opt-in/opt-out process described in Section 4.3.5., an applicable
neighborhood association or neighborhood planning team may request that the affordable
rental units be available for renters earning a lower percentage of the annual median
family income, to as low as 60 percent of the median family income. VMU projects that
file zoning or site plan applications after the effective date of the first interim
VMU ordinance and prior to September 1, 2006, will not be subject to this neighborhood
affordability customization; and instead shall set aside affordable rental units as
required by subsection 2.a. above or provide for affordable units as otherwise agreed
to by an applicable neighborhood prior to September 1,2006, provided that VMU projects
are allowed on the applicable site following the completion of the opt-in/opt-out
process.

c.

The city may elect to subsidize an additional ten percent of the residential units
in the building for rental purposes for residents at any level of affordability pursuant
to criteria and procedures established by the Director.

3.

Affordability Definition. For purposes of this subsection, a unit is affordable for purchase or rental if the
household is required to spend no more than 30 percent of its gross monthly income
on utilities and mortage or rental payments for the unit as determined by the City's
Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department, based on the current Annual
Median Family Income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

4.

Fee for Upper-Level Nonresidential Space. The developers of VMU buildings that contain nonresidential uses above the ground-floor
shall pay a fee as set by the City Council for all climate-controlled nonresidential
space above the ground floor. At the same time that it sets the amount of the fee,
the City Council shall also identify a means by which fees paid pursuant to this section
shall be reserved only for expenditure within the area of the City from which they
were collected.

5.

Monitoring and Enforcement. The City shall develop procedures to monitor and enforce this section.

G.

Mixed Use Buildings Other than VMU. If a building that otherwise meets the standards for VMU buildings may be developed
using the site development standards of the underlying zoning category, and without
the use of the dimensional standard waivers of Section 4.3.3.E., then that building
need not comply with the standards (including affordability) that otherwise apply
to VMU buildings.

4.3.4.
  Development Bonuses and Expedited Review of Residential Parking Permit Districts.

A.

Bonuses for VMU Buildings. A building that contains at least 100 lineal feet of VMU building frontage along
the principal street is entitled to the following development bonuses:

1.

The queuing requirements of Chapter 25-6, Appendix A, shall be reduced by 50 percent for each drive-through service in the
development, so long as sufficient on-site queuing space exists to ensure queuing
does not occur within the public right-of-way.

2.

The number of connectivity options needed to comply with Section 2.3.1.B.2. of this
Subchapter shall be reduced by two for each 100 lineal feet of VMU buildings.

3.

All buildings in the development may aggregate points for building design in Section
3.3 of this Subchapter, rather than each building needing the minimum number of points.

4.

Except for in the Barton Springs Zone or the Waterfront Overlay combining district,
impervious cover existing as of the effective date of this Subchapter may be retained
for redevelopment purposes for VMU buildings no taller than 60 feet and their accompanying
structured parking, so long as the redevelopment meets current water quality standards
and, for projects in the Drinking Water Protection Zone, the redevelopment incorporates
the following measures to provide additional water quality benefits, pursuant to administrative
rules to be developed by the director:

a.

Rainwater collection and reuse;

b.

Pervious pavement;

c.

Integrated pest management; and

d.

Native and adapted landscaping.

B.

Expedited Review for Residential Permit Parking Districts. Neighborhoods that do not opt out of the VMU overlay district pursuant to the process
established in
Section 4.3.5.
shall receive expedited review of applications to establish Residential Permit Parking
(RPP) districts, for blocks starting within 600 feet of the portion of the Core Transit
Corridor or Future Core Transit Corridor within the VMU overlay. The application process
shall proceed in accordance with the guidelines and procedures which are in effect
at the time of the application except as described below:

1.

The applicable neighborhood association must endorse the resident's request for the
Residential Permit Parking program.

2.

Requirements for conducting parking studies or collecting license plate information
shall be waived.

3.

RPP request documentation to City staff, staff shall review and act on the application
within two weeks. Notice shall be sent to affected residents and the applicable neighborhood
association, and signs shall be installed, within six weeks of approval.

4.3.5.
  Individual Neighborhood Consideration of VMU Requirements ("Opt-in/Opt-out Process").

A.

Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to establish a one-time process, which will begin
following the adoption of this Subchapter, whereby individual neighborhoods may consider
certain development characteristics of VMU buildings within their boundaries and communicate
their preferences to the City Council. No property is eligible for an exemption from
the dimensional standards (of Section 4.3.3.E.2.) or for the additional ground-floor
uses otherwise authorized by Section 4.3.3.C.2. until the conclusion of the opt-in
and opt-out processes described in this section.

B.

Procedure.

1.

Initiation. Upon the adoption date of this Subchapter, the Director shall identify neighborhood
areas and notify each neighborhood planning team that the VMU neighborhood consideration
process shall be initiated. If there is no neighborhood planning team, the applicable
neighborhood associations in a neighborhood shall work together to develop an opt-in/opt-out
application for the purposes of this section.

2.

Application. Each neighborhood planning team or neighborhood association shall review the VMU
standards in Section 4.3.3. The planning team or applicable neighborhood association
may, no later than 90 days after receiving written notice from the Director of this
Subchapter's adoption, submit an opt-in/optout application to the City Manager concerning
any of the items listed in subsection C. below. The planning team or neighborhood
association may amend a timely filed application not later than August 9, 2007.

3.

Planning Commission Recommendation. The City Manager shall forward any opt-in/opt-out applications received to the Planning
Commission, which shall review and make recommendations on all such applications to
the City Council.

4.

City Council Decision. After considering the Planning Commission's recommendations, the Council may by ordinance
approve, approve with conditions, or deny each opt-in/optout request. The Council
may concurrently amend the appropriate neighborhood plan. The neighborhood plan amendment
process does not apply to the amendment.

5.

Effect of Approval. Following completion of this one-time opt-in/opt-out process:

a.

The director shall indicate on the zoning map with map code "V" each property receiving
an exemption from the dimensional standards under Section 4.3.3.E.2, additional ground
floor commercial uses under Section 4.3.3.C.2, or a reduction in the median family
income for affordable rental housing under Section 4.3.3.F.2.b. The "V" shall include
properties receiving the exemption under Section 4.3.5.B.4. pursuant to Council action
on an opt-out application, or under Section 4.3.5.C.l.b. if no application has been
filed.

b.

Any subsequent amendments to the VMU standards in a neighborhood shall require amendment
of the applicable neighborhood plan and neighborhood plan combining district.

c.

Any property owner or neighborhood association may submit an application to change
the VMU rules on a specific property or properties by amending the applicable neighborhood
plan and neighborhood plan combining district to opt-in to the exemption from the
dimensional standards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 and/or the additional ground-floor uses
identified by Section 4.3.3.C.2.

d.

Any property owner may file a zoning application for Vertical Mixed Use (V) or Mixed
Use (MU) combining district, regardless of whether a neighborhood plan combining district
has been adopted.

C.

Types of Opt-in/Opt-Out Applications. Only the following types of opt-in/opt-out applications may be submitted:

1.

VMU Overlay District: Opt-out.

a.

A neighborhood with properties in the VMU overlay district may request that the neighborhood
"opt-out" of the dimensional standards exemption in Section 4.3.3.E.2., and/or the
ground-floor commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the
properties within the VMU overlay district. If such an opt-out application is submitted
and approved, the applicable standards shall not apply to affected VMU buildings within
that neighborhood; instead, such buildings shall be required to comply with all dimensional
and/or use standards applicable to the base zoning district. Such buildings also shall
comply with the applicable minimum site area requirements in the MU combining district;
see Section 4.2.1.D.6.

b.

If no opt-out application is submitted on a property, or an opt-out application is
submitted and denied, the dimensional standard exemption in Section 4.3.3.E.2. and
the ground-floor commercial use provisions in Section 4.3.3.C.2. shall apply to all
VMU buildings on that property.

2.

MU-Designated Properties: Opt-in.

a.

A neighborhood with properties with the MU zoning designation may request to "opt-in"
to the dimensional standards exemption in Section 4.3.3.E.2., and/or the ground floor
commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the properties with
the MU zoning designation. If such an opt-in application is submitted and approved,
the dimensional and/or use standards shall apply to VMU buildings on sites with the
MU zoning designation within the applicable neighborhood boundaries.

b.

If no opt-in application is submitted for a property, or an opt-in application is
submitted and denied, VMU buildings on a property designated MU shall comply with
all dimensional and use standards applicable to the base zoning district and the MU
combining district.

3.

Properties Not in VMU Overlay District and without MU Designation: Opt-in to VMU. Any neighborhood that desires to allow VMU buildings within its boundaries on commercially
zoned properties that are not otherwise eligible for VMU buildings under this Subchapter
may submit an "opt-in" application to allow such development. The application shall
specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow VMU buildings, whether
the ground-floor commercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. should be allowed, and whether
the dimensional standards exemption of Section 4.3.3.E.2. should apply.

4.

All Properties that Allow VMU Buildings: Affordability Standards. Also as part of the opt-in/opt-out process, for each neighborhood in which VMU buildings
are allowed, the neighborhood association or neighborhood planning team may request
that the affordable rental units be available for renters earning a lower percentage
of the area median family income, to as low as 60 percent of the median family income,
pursuant to Section 4.3.3.F.2.b.

5.

VMU Overlay District: Residential Opt-in. A neighbor-hood that desires to allow VMU buildings within its boundaries on property
in a VMU overlay district that is used exclusively for residential use and that is
not designated as a MU combining district may submit an application to allow the development.
The application shall specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow
VMU buildings, whether ground-floor commercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2 should
be allowed, and whether the dimensional standards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 should apply.

6.

Removal from the VMU Overlay District. A neighborhood may request that the Council amend the boundaries of the VMU overlay
district to remove a property from the overlay district.

A.

Minimum Setback Required. The minimum front yard setback required for development
subject to this Subchapter is the lesser of:

1.

The minimum front yard setback prescribed by the other provisions of this Code; or

2.

The average front yard setback, if an average may be determined as provided in Subsection
B. below.

B.

Average Front Yard Setback. The following rules apply for purposes of the setback
calculation required by Paragraph A.2:

1.

A front yard setback is the distance between the front lot line and the closest front
exterior wall or building façade of the principal residential structure located on
the lot.

2.

Except as provided in paragraph 3, average front yard setback is determined using
the front yard setback of the four principal residential structures that are: (a)
built within fifty feet of the front lot line; and (b) closest to, and on the same
side of the block, as the property subject to the setback required by this section.

3.

If less than four structures satisfy the criteria in paragraph B.2, average front
yard setback is calculated using the number of existing residential structures on
the same side of the street block as the property subject to the setback required
by this section. If there are no structures on the same side of the block, average
front yard setback is calculated using the front yard setbacks of the four structures
on the opposite side of the block that are closest to the property subject to the
setback required by this section. If there are less than four structures on the opposite
side of the block, the lesser number of structures is used in the calculation. See
Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Average Front Yard Setback](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig1.png)

Figure 1: Average Front Yard Setback

In this example, the minimum required front setback in the underlying zoning district
is 25 feet. However, because of the variety in existing setbacks of buildings on the
same block face, new development on lot C may be located with a setback of only 20
feet, which is the average of the setbacks of lots B, D, and E. The building on lot
A is not included in the average because it is located more than 50 feet from the
property line.

provisions of this Code, but the minimum rear yard setback of a second dwelling unit
may be reduced to five feet if the rear lot line is adjacent to an alley. See Figure

This subsection prescribes side and rear setback planes in order to minimize the impact
of new development and rear development on adjacent properties. A structure may not
extend beyond a setback plane except as authorized by subsection D. below. The height
of a setback plane shall be measured under the requirements defined in Section 3.4.

A.

Side Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection B. below, an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side
setback plane begins at a horizontal line 15 feet directly above the side property
line. The 15-foot height of the horizontal line is established for 40-foot deep portions
of the lot beginning at the building line and extending to the rear of the lot, except
that the last portion at the rear of the lot may be less than 40 feet deep. See Figures
3 through 5.

1.

For the first portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the
highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines, the building
line, and a line 40 feet from and parallel to the building line.

2.

For successive portions other than the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal
line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the
side lot lines and the appropriate two lines that are 40 feet apart and parallel to
the building line.

3.

For the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the
highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines, the appropriate
line parallel to the building line, and the rear lot line.

Figure 5: Determining High Points on a Sloping Lot

For each portion of the side setback plane, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line
is measured starting from the highest point of the four intersections defining the
portion. In this example, topography lines indicate that the lot is sloping downward
from the rear to the front of the lot, and from the right to the left. The high points
for Portions 1, 2, and 3 are indicated, along with the Building Line.

B.

Rear Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection D., an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback
plane begins at a horizontal line directly above the rear property line at the same
elevation as the horizontal line for the last portion of the side setback plane established
in paragraph A.3. See Figures 6 through 9.

The side and rear setback planes form a "tent" over the lot, rising from the property
lines for 15 feet and then angling in at 45-degree angles from the side and rear.
The required front, rear, and side yard setbacks are indicated by the darker shading
on the ground.

C.

Buildable Area. The buildable area, as defined in Section 3.3., consists of the smallest area within
the front, side, and rear yard setbacks; maximum height limit; and the combined side
and rear setback planes. See Figures 10 and 11.

![Figure 10: Buildable Area (Combination of Yard Setbacks, Maximum Height Limit, and Setback Planes)](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig10.png)

Figure 10: Buildable Area (Combination of Yard Setbacks, Maximum Height Limit, and

The heavy blue line indicates the "tent" formed by the side and rear setback planes.
The buildable area is the smallest area included within the front, side, and rear
yard setbacks; maximum height limit; and the combined side and rear setback planes
(shown here as the green area).

![Figure 11: Buildable Area on Corner Lot](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig11.png)

Figure 11: Buildable Area on Corner Lot

This figure shows the same concept illustrated in Figure 10 but for a corner lot that
has a greater street side yard setback requirement. In this example, the minimum required
street side yard setback in the underlying zoning district is 15 feet. Because the
side setback plane is measured from the side property line, the height of the setback
plane is 30 feet at the 15-foot street side yard setback line.

D.

Side and Rear Setback Plane Exceptions for Existing One-Story Buildings.

1.

Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story
to a one-story building may choose either of the following side setback planes for
the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed,
or permitted for original construction, before October 1, 2006:

a.

The side setback plane required under subsection A.

b.

The inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane that begins at a horizontal
line directly above the outermost side wall at a height equal to the height of the
first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit
before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half feet. See Figure 12. The wall plate is
the lowest point of the existing first floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior
wall.

2.

Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story
to a one-story building may choose either of the following rear setback planes for
the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed,
or permitted for original construction, before October 1, 2006:

a.

The rear setback plane required under subsection B.

b.

An inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback plane that begins at a horizontal
line directly above the rear property line at a height equal to the height of the
first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit
before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half feet.

3.

The side setback plane required under subsection A, and the rear setback plane required
under subsection B, apply to:

a.

any portion of the proposed construction that is outside of the building footprint
originally constructed, or permitted for original construction, before October 1,
2006; and

b.

the entire project, if any portion of the proposed construction requires the removal
or demolition of exterior walls.

![Figure 12: Side Setback Plane Exception for Existing Single-Story Buildings](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig12.png)

Figure 12: Side Setback Plane Exception for Existing Single-Story Buildings

The side setback planes for an existing single-story building are determined based
on the height of the sidewall. In this example, the horizontal line that forms the
base of the setback plane is placed ten feet and six inches above the sidewall height
(12 feet). The revised plane rises above the standard setback plane within the area
of the building footprint. The standard setback planes created in Sections 2.6. A.
and B. apply outside of the existing footprint.

E.

Exceptions. A structure may not extend beyond a setback plane, except for:

1.

A roof overhang or eave, up to two feet beyond the setback plane;

2.

A chimney, vent, antenna, or energy conservation or production equipment or feature
not designed for occupancy; and

3.

Either:

a.

30-Foot Side-Gabled Roof Exception. A side-gabled roof structure on each side of the building, with a total horizontal
length of not more than 30 feet, measured from the building line along the intersection
with the side setback plane (See Figure 13.); or

b.

Gables Plus Dormers Exception.

(i)

Gables or a shed roof, with a total horizontal length of not more than 18 feet on
each side of the building, measured along the intersection with the setback plane
(See Figures 14 and 17.); and

(ii)

Dormers, with a total horizontal length of not more than 15 feet on each side of the
building, measured along the intersection with the setback plane. (See Figures 15
and 16.)

![Figure 13: Side-Gabled Rood Exception](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/SubCHF-Fig13.png)

Figure 13: Side-Gabled Rood Exception

A side-gabled roof may project through the side setback plane for a horizontal distance
of up to a maximum of 30 feet, measured from the building line. In this example, the
gable intrudes into the setback plane beginning 9 feet behind the building line. Therefore,
the maximum length of the gable intrusion would be 21 feet.

2.7.1.

Except as provided in subsection 2.7.2, if a side wall of a building is more than
15 feet high and is an average distance of less than nine feet from an interior lot
line, the sidewall may not extend in an unbroken plane for more than 36 feet along
a side lot line without a sidewall articulation that meets the requirements of this
section.

A.

To beak the plane, a sidewall articulation must:

1.

be perpendicular to the side property line, at least four feet deep, and extend along
the side property line for at least 10 feet, as shown in Figures 18 through 20;

2.

extend the entire height of the first floor of an addition to, or remodel of, an existing
one-story building;

3.

extend the entire height of the second story of an addition to, or remodel of, a two
or more story building;

4.

extend to the height of the top floor of a newly constructed building; and

5.

extend evenly upward for its entire height.

B.

A sidewall articulation cannot:

1.

create patios or decks or be screened from view; or

2.

serve as an eave or gutter.

C.

Sidewall articulation required under this section may be satisfied by horizontal articulation,
such that each story above the first story is setback further from the property line
by at least nine feet and extends along the side property line for at least 10 feet.

D.

For purposes of subsection 2.7.1, wall height:

1.

excludes side gables; and

2.

is measured from the lower of natural or finished grade adjacent to the structure
up to the first floor wall plate, which is the lowest point of the existing first
floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior wall.

2.7.2.

The requirements of this section do not apply to:

A.

Any side of a structure that is adjacent to a commercial use, unless the commercial
use is occupying a residential structure.

B.

An addition to or remodel of an existing principal structure, or the construction
of a new principal structure, provided that the resulting structure is less than 2,000
square feet in net building coverage and less than or equal to 32 feet in height.

C.

An addition to or remodel of an existing second structure, or the construction of
a new second structure, provided that the principal structure is exempt under subsection
2.7.2.B and the resulting second structure:

1.

does not exceed 550 square feet;

2.

does not exceed the maximum height allowed in the base zoning district; and

3.

is either detached from the principal structure or connected by a covered breezeway
that is open on all sides, with a walkway of no more than six (6) feet in width that
is covered by a roof of no more than eight (8) feet in width.

D.

The addition of a second story to an existing one-story structure if the addition
is directly above a portion of the existing one-story structure that was originally
constructed, or received a permit for construction, before October 1, 2006.

E.

An extension of the second floor of an existing two-story structure, provided that
the building footprint of the structure is not increased.

## CHAPTER 25-3. - TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT.

This chapter regulates the design and development of a traditional neighborhood zoning
district.

Source: Section 13-9-1; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

(A)

The purpose of a traditional neighborhood district is to encourage mixed-use, compact
development that is sensitive to the environmental characteristics of the land and
facilitates the efficient use of services. A traditional neighborhood district diversifies
and integrates land uses within close proximity to each other, and it provides for
the daily recreational and shopping needs of the residents. A traditional neighborhood
district is a sustainable, long-term community that provides economic opportunity
and environmental and social equity for the residents.

(B)

A traditional neighborhood district is designed to ensure the development of land
as a traditional neighborhood. Its design adopts the urban conventions which were
the norm in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's. A traditional
neighborhood district is characterized by the following design elements:

(1)

neighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity;

(2)

a variety of housing types, jobs, shopping, services, and public facilities;

(3)

residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings interwoven within the neighborhood,
all within close proximity;

(4)

a network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the natural
landscape;

(5)

natural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the open space of
the neighborhood;

(6)

a coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities
for pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and automotive vehicles;

(7)

well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts,
and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood and dedicated to the collective
social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the populace;

(8)

civic buildings, open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols,
and focal points for community identity;

(9)

compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement,
bulk, form, character, and landscaping to establish a livable, harmonious, and diverse
environment;

(10)

private buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge and define the border between
the public street space and the private block interior; and

(11)

architecture and landscape that respond to the unique character of the region.

Source: Section 13-9-2; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

(A)

A traditional neighborhood district consists of an area of not less than 40 contiguous
acres and not more than 250 contiguous acres. In this chapter, property is considered
contiguous even if separated by a public roadway.

(B)

A traditional neighborhood district is divided into at least two types of Areas, and
each type of Area has different land use and site development regulations. A traditional
neighborhood district must have one Neighborhood Center Area and at least one Mixed
Residential Area. A traditional neighborhood district may also have a Neighborhood
Edge Area, a Workshop Area, or an Employment Center Area.

(C)

A Neighborhood Center Area serves as the focal point of a traditional neighborhood
district, containing retail, commercial, civic, and public services to meet the daily
needs of community residents. A Neighborhood Center is pedestrian-oriented, and it
is designed to encourage pedestrian movement between a Mixed Residential Area and
a Neighborhood Center Area. A square is required in a Neighborhood Center Area. Retail
and commercial uses should generally be located adjacent to a square. Neighborhood
Center Area uses include retail shops, restaurants, offices, banks, hotels, post office,
governmental offices, churches, community centers, and attached residential dwellings.

(D)

A Mixed Residential Area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family
residential, duplex, townhouse, and multi-family. Residential scale retail and commercial
uses are permitted within a Mixed Residential area with strict architectural and land
use controls. Retail and commercial uses in a Mixed Residential area are required
to blend into the residential character of the neighborhood. A Mixed Residential area
includes open spaces including small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts.
A Mixed Residential Area promotes pedestrian activity through well designed and varied
streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic.
Mixed Residential Area uses include single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses,
apartments, offices, restaurants, neighborhood scale retail, and civic uses.

(E)

A Neighborhood Edge Area is the least dense portion of a traditional neighborhood
district, with larger lots and greater setbacks than the rest of the neighborhood.
Alleys are not required, and direct vehicular access to the street is permitted. Only
single family residential dwellings are permitted. A Neighborhood Edge Area is appropriate
along the perimeter of the neighborhood. A portion of a traditional neighborhood district
that adjoins existing or platted conventional low density housing must be designated
as a Neighborhood Edge Area.

(F)

A traditional neighborhood district may have a Workshop Area, an Employment Center
Area, or both. Commercial and light industrial uses that are not appropriate for a
Neighborhood Center Area or a Mixed Residential Area but which serve the local residents
may be located in a Workshop Area. Large office and low-impact manufacturing uses
may be located within an Employment Center Area. The scale and architectural conventions
of a traditional neighborhood district apply to a Workshop area and an Employment
Center Area.

(G)

Civic uses that are oriented to the general public are permitted in a Neighborhood
Center Area and a Mixed Residential Area. These uses are essential components of the
social and physical fabric of a traditional neighborhood district. Special attention
should be paid to the location of government offices, libraries, museums, schools,
churches, and other prominent public buildings to create focal points and landmarks
for the community. The locations of these major public civic uses are designated on
the Development Plan at the time of zoning approval.

(H)

Open space is a significant part of a traditional neighborhood district design. Formal
and informal open spaces are required. These serve as areas for community gatherings,
landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares,
plazas, greens, preserves, parks, and greenbelts.

(I)

A traditional neighborhood district is designed to be pedestrian oriented. To accomplish
this goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle travel speeds and encourage
pedestrian activity. An interconnected network of streets and alleys is required.
Streets may be smaller than in conventional development and more varied in size and
form to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood.

The subdivision procedures in Chapter 25-4 (Subdivision) apply to the traditional neighborhood district, except as follows:

(1)

All property within a traditional neighborhood district must be subdivided under this
chapter. A previously approved final subdivision plat must be vacated, and a previously
approved preliminary subdivision plan must be withdrawn.

(2)

The traditional neighborhood district shall be on one preliminary subdivision plan.

(3)

An open space area shall be included in the final subdivision plat of adjacent property.
All open space areas must be platted as separate open space lots.

(4)

A final subdivision plat may not be approved unless there has been compliance with
the provisions of this chapter relating to a Property Owners' Association, Architectural
Standards, Land Use Allocations, Drainage, and Water Quality.

(5)

A final subdivision plat for more than 50 percent of the land area covered by the
preliminary subdivision plan may not be approved until construction of the community
meeting hall has begun. Once begun, the construction of the community meeting hall
must be diligently pursued to completion.

(6)

Improvements to private open spaces, except those included in a construction phasing
plan for major private open space improvements, shall be constructed by the subdivider
as part of the subdivision infrastructure.

Source: Section 13-9-31; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

(A)

Street monuments and property markers.

(1)

Property pins or other forms of permanent markers identified in the most recent edition
of the Manual of Practice for Land Surveying in Texas, published by the Texas Society
of Professional Surveyors, shall be placed by the surveyor at all corners of boundary
lines of a subdivision. Pins and markers may not be spaced more than 1,300 feet apart.
One corner of the subdivision shall be identified by a concrete monument unless a
concrete monument exists on an adjacent platted subdivision within 1,300 feet of the
proposed plat.

(2)

If a concrete monument exists on an adjacent platted subdivision within 1,300 feet
of the proposed plat, no concrete monuments are required for the proposed plat. In
that instance, boundary corners may be set with permanent markers identified in the
most recent edition of Manual of Practice for Land Surveying in Texas.

(3)

Intermediate property corners, curve points, and angle points shall be marked by iron
stakes.

(B)

Easements for public utilities and enclosed or open drainage ways shall be retained
in all subdivisions in the widths and locations deemed necessary by the director.
To the extent practicable, the easements for water lines, wastewater lines, and storm
sewers shall be located in the street rights-of-way, and the easements for all other
utilities shall be located in the alley rights-of-way. All the easements shall be
dedicated to public use for the named purpose and shall be aligned to minimize construction
cost.

(C)

Utilities shall be located underground unless this requirement is, for good cause,
waived by the director, and, if applicable, the director of the Electric Utility Department.

(D)

When the director finds that easements in areas adjoining a proposed subdivision are
necessary to provide adequate drainage or to serve the subdivision with utilities,
the subdivider shall obtain the easements or make arrangements with the City to obtain
them.

(E)

Streets of new subdivisions shall be aligned with existing streets on adjoining property
unless the Land Use Commission determines that the Comprehensive Plan, topography,
requirements of traffic circulation, or other considerations make it desirable to
depart from the alignment.

(F)

Each lot in a subdivision, except a lot that fronts on a plaza and abuts an alley,
shall abut a dedicated public street.

(G)

Except in a Neighborhood Edge Area, each lot in a subdivision shall abut an alley
unless the director determines that good cause exists to omit an alley or portion
of an alley.

(H)

An interconnected network of streets is required unless the director determines that
good cause exists to require a different street pattern.

(I)

Streets, alleys, and pedestrian paths shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with this chapter, the Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria Manual, the Standards
Criteria Manual, and the Standard Specifications Criteria Manual.

(J)

New streets in subdivisions shall be named to provide continuity of name with existing
streets and to prevent conflict with identical or similarly spelled or pronounced
names in other parts of the city's planning jurisdiction.

(K)

Street intersections, whether public or private streets, shall be designed in accordance
with the provisions of the Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria Manual and the
Transportation Criteria Manual.

(L)

Dead-end streets are prohibited unless the director determines that the most desirable
plan requires laying out a dead-end street. A dead-end street shall terminate in a
courtyard designed in accordance with the Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria
Manual, unless the director determines that topography, density, adequate circulation,
or other unusual conditions require a deviation from the design criteria in the Traditional
Neighborhood District Criteria Manual.

(M)

The side lines of lots in subdivisions shall be approximately at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines. An arrangement placing adjacent lots
at right angles to each other shall be avoided.

(N)

Block length may not exceed 600 feet. Block width may not exceed 300 feet. The director
may approve a block width of not more than 400 feet or a block length of not more
than 1000 feet if required because of topography or existing street layout, but a
block longer than 800 feet must be traversed by a pedestrian path near the midpoint.

(O)

Minimum lot size, maximum lot size, and minimum lot width are specified in the site
development regulations contained in this chapter for a Neighborhood Center Area,
a Mixed Residential Area, a Neighborhood Edge Area, a Workshop Area, and an Employment
Center Area. Open space lots must comply with the dimensional requirements of this
chapter.

(P)

Townhouse lots may be created where each townhouse lot is to be served by a public
sewage system, subject to the following conditions in addition to those applicable
to all other subdivisions:

(1)

All common areas shall be clearly identified on the plat and adequate provisions made
for maintenance and taxation.

(2)

There may be not less than two and not more than eight units in a townhouse group.

(3)

Not more than one townhouse may be located on a lot.

(4)

the portion of the original tract contiguous to the area to be subdivided has direct
access to a public street, or the applicant has provided access to a public street
by dedicating right-of-way at least 50 feet wide;

(a)

the owner's land is not a legal lot or tract; and

(b)

the owner must plat the land before the City may approve a development permit or a
utility company may provide initial or additional service.

(D)

In making a determination under Subsection (D)(3) that a reasonable use of the balance
of the original tract is possible, the director may require that the applicant provide
a schematic land plan of the balance of the original tract. The director may not require

Ord. No. 20170302-077, Pt. 2, effective March 13, 2017 amended Article 2 title to read as herein set out.
Formerly, such article pertained to reservation and dedication of right-of-way.

(A)

Except as provided in Subsection (B), this article applies to land for which an owner
files an application for:

(1)

zoning or rezoning;

(2)

preliminary plan or final plat approval; or

(3)

site plan approval.

(B)

This article does not apply to an application for:

(1)

a minor revision of an approved site plan;

(2)

a development permit for a lot in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City; or

(3)

a site plan application for a developed property or a site plan revision application
for a property with an approved site plan that is filed to relocate facilities from
an area of the property to be condemned for right-of-way.

Source: Section 13-5-2; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

The provisions of this article relating to the reservation of right-of-way and waiver
of reservation of right-of-way requirements, do not preclude the City from establishing
a building line on a right-of-way under state law.

Source: Section 13-5-4; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.

(A)

If the City requires an applicant to dedicate right-of-way, construct or fund system
transportation improvements, or dedicate right-of-way beyond the boundaries of a development,
the applicant's costs may not exceed the amount required for infrastructure improvements
that is roughly proportionate to the proposed development as determined by a professional
engineer licensed under Chapter 1001, Occupations Code, and retained by the City.

(B)

The director shall issue a written determination of an applicant's roughly proportionate
share of infrastructure costs attributable to a proposed development prior to approval
of an application for which dedication or reservation of right-of-way or the construction
or funding of system transportation improvements is required. A determination issued
under this section:

(1)

need not be made to a mathematical certainty, but is intended to be used as a tool
to fairly assess the roughly proportionate impacts of a development based on the level
of transportation demand created by a proposed development relative to the capacity
of existing public infrastructure;

(2)

shall be completed in accordance with generally recognized and approved measurements,
assumptions, procedures, formulas, and development principles; and

(3)

shall state the roughly proportionate share to the property owner for the dedication
and construction of transportation-related improvements necessary to ensure an effective
and safe transportation system that is sufficient to accommodate the traffic generated
by a proposed development.

(C)

If a proposed development is subject to a proportionality determination under this
section, the director shall identify in writing all infrastructure improvements required
in conjunction with approval of the development application. The infrastructure improvements
may include right-of-way dedication or reservation, the construction or funding of
system improvements, or any combination thereof, in an amount not to exceed the total
infrastructure costs attributable to the proposed development as established by the
proportionality determination.

(D)

To aid in making a proportionality determination and identifying required infrastructure
improvements, the director may:

(1)

adopt administrative guidelines establishing requirements for:

(a)

conducting a traffic impact analysis and neighborhood traffic analysis under Article
3 (Traffic Impact Analysis and Mitigation); and

(b)

funding or constructing system transportation improvements required under Section
25-6-101 (Mitigation of Transportation Impacts); and

(2)

if an applicant contests the director's proportionality determination under this section,
require an applicant to provide:

(a)

a transportation impact analysis, regardless of whether one is required under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis Required);

(b)

a neighborhood traffic analysis, regardless of whether one is required under Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood Traffic Analysis Required); or

(c)

other information related to the traffic and safety impacts of a proposed development.

(A)

The City may, as a condition to approval of a site plan or subdivision, require the
reservation of right-of-way that is reasonably likely to be acquired for public use
consistent with this article. To be subject to reservation, land must be located along
a roadway designated in:

(1)

the Transportation Plan;

(2)

an approved collector plan; or

(3)

an established capital improvement project located in the planning jurisdiction of
the City.

(B)

The extent and location of the right-of-way reserved under Subsection (A) must conform
to the Transportation Plan, approved collector plan, or capital improvement project.

Ord. No. 20170302-077, Pt. 5, effective March 13, 2017 amended article 3 title to read as herein set out.
Formerly, such article pertained to traffic impact analysis.

(A)

In addition to requiring dedication of right-of-way under Section 25-6-55 (Dedication Of Right-Of-Way), the director may require an applicant to construct or fund all or a portion of
system improvements required to mitigate traffic impacts of a proposed development.

(B)

If a proposed development does not require an impact analysis under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis Described) or Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood Traffic Impact Analysis Described), the director may condition approval of the application on construction or funding
of system improvements as described in this subsection:

(1)

System improvements are limited to:

(a)

sidewalks and curb ramps;

(b)

traffic signs, markings, and upgrades to signal infrastructure;

(c)

traffic calming devices;

(d)

bike lanes or upgrades to bike facilities;

(e)

rectangular rapid flashing beacons;

(f)

pedestrian refuge islands;

(g)

pedestrian hybrid beacons;

(h)

urban trail improvements;

(i)

right-of-way dedications; and

(j)

measures to limit transportation demand.

(2)

System improvements required under this section must be located:

(a)

within the boundaries of the development for which they are required; or

(b)

no farther from the proposed development than:

(i)

one-quarter mile; or

(ii)

three-fourths of a mile, for an improvement required to provide access between the
proposed development and a school, bus stop, public space, or major roadway as designated
under the transportation plan.

(C)

If a proposed development requires a traffic impact analysis under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis) or Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood Traffic Impact Analysis), the director may require an applicant to construct or fund system improvements
identified by the traffic impact analysis.

(D)

The total cost of system improvements required under this section may not exceed the
lesser of:

(1)

the applicant's roughly proportionate share of infrastructure costs as established
by the proportionality determination required under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality Of Required Infrastructure), less the cost of any right-of-way dedication required under Section 25-6-55 (Dedication of Right-of-Way); or

(2)

the total cost of offsite transportation improvements identified in a traffic impact
analysis approved by the director, whether or not the analysis is required under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis Required) or submitted by an applicant voluntarily.

Source: Ord. No. 20170302-077, Pt. 6, 3-13-17.

(A)

The director may allow an applicant to pay a fee in-lieu of constructing one or more
transportation system improvements required under Section 25-6-101 (Mitigation of Transportation Impacts) or, at the director's discretion, to post fiscal surety in the amount of the required
fee in-lieu. In determining whether to allow payment of a fee in-lieu or fiscal surety,
or to require construction of system improvements, the director shall consider:

(1)

the applicant's roughly proportionate share of infrastructure costs, as determined
under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality Of Required Infrastructure), relative to the cost of constructing one or more identified system improvements;

(2)

future transportation improvements anticipated for the area through capital improvement
projects or as a condition to the approval of other proposed developments; and

(3)

the feasibility of constructing one or more identified system improvements by supplementing
the amount collected through payment of a fee in-lieu with city funds.

(B)

A fee in-lieu collected under Subsection (A) of this section shall be placed in a
dedicated fund and used solely for the purpose of constructing one or more system
improvements identified under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality Of Required Infrastructure).

(C)

A fee in-lieu collected under this section shall be spent, consistent with the requirements
of Subsection (B), within ten years from the date fee is paid to the City. The owner
of a property for which a fee in-lieu was paid under this section may request a refund
of any funds that remain unspent after the end of the ten-year period. A refund request
under this section must be submitted in writing, on a form provided by the director.

in the City's S.M.A.R.T. Housing program established under City Code Chapter 25-1, Article 15, Division 2 (S.M.A.R.T. Housing).

(B)

If a S.M.A.R.T. housing development does not require an impact analysis under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis Described) or Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood Traffic Impact Analysis Described), the maximum cost of system improvements that may be required under Section 25-6-101(B) (Mitigation Of Transportation Impacts) is reduced according to the following requirements:

(1)

If at least ten percent, but less than twenty percent, of the dwelling units are reasonably-priced,
the maximum cost is reduced by the percentage of affordable units;

(2)

If at least twenty percent, but less than fifty percent, of the dwelling units are
reasonably-priced, the maximum cost is reduced by fifty percent; and

(3)

If at least fifty percent of the dwelling units are reasonably-priced, no mitigation
may be required.

the parking is onsite or offsite.

Editor's note—Amendments to division (B) of this section made by Ord. 20130523-104 did not take
into account amendments previously made by Ord. 20130411-061. The amendments enacted
by Ord. 20130523-104 have therefore been made only to other parts of the section that
do not conflict with Ord. 20130411-061. Future legislation will correct the text if
needed.

(1)

If off-street parking is provided, it must include parking for persons with disabilities
as required by the Building Code and may not include fewer accessible spaces than

in a designated historic district, off-street motor vehicle parking for persons with
disabilities must be provided for a use that occupies 6,000 square feet or more of
floor space under the requirements of this paragraph.

(a)

The following requirements apply if no parking is provided for a use, other than parking
for persons with disabilities:

(i)

the minimum number of accessible parking spaces is calculated by taking 100 percent
of the parking previously required for the use under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) and using that result to determine the number of accessible spaces required under
the Building Code. The accessible spaces may be provided on- or off-site, within 250
feet of the use and must be on an accessible route.

(ii)

The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required under Paragraph
(2)(a)(i) if the applicant pays a fee in-lieu to be used by the city to construct
and maintain accessible parking in the vicinity of the use. The availability of this
option is contingent on the establishment of a fee by separate ordinance and the adoption
of a program by the director to administer the fee and establish eligibility criteria.
A decision by the director that a use is ineligible for a fee in-lieu is final.

(iii)

The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required if no accessible
spaces can be provided consistent with the requirements of Paragraph (2)(a)(i) and
the use is ineligible for participation in the fee in-lieu program under Paragraph
(2)(a)(ii).

(iv)

An off-site or on-street parking space designated for persons with disabilities that
is located within 250 feet of a use may be counted towards the number of parking spaces
the use is required to provide under Paragraph (2)(a)(i).

The maximum number of parking spaces allowed under Subsection (B)(3) of this section
may be increased at the request of an applicant under the requirements of this subsection.

(1)

The director shall approve an increase if all parking spaces are contained in a parking
structure and the total number of spaces is less than 110 percent of the spaces calculated
under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).

(2)

Only if bicycle parking is also increased proportionately.

(D)

The Land Use Commission may waive the requirement of Subsection (B)(5) of this section
during the site plan review process after determining that:

(1)

present and anticipated development in the area is not amenable to access by pedestrians;

(2)

the requirement does not allow a reasonable use of the property; or

(3)

other circumstances attributable to the property make compliance impractical.

(E)

waived must be screened.

(F)

This subsection applies to property zoned CBD and DMU.

(1)

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the maximum number of motor vehicle

fewer residential units can include up to 60 percent of motor vehicle parking spaces
formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements).

(3)

The maximum number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed is 80 percent of the number
of motor vehicle parking spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) if:

(a)

all parking spaces are contained in a parking structure;

(b)

the director finds that allowing additional parking spaces does not impact public
health, safety, or welfare or undermine established planning policies for the area;
and

(c)

one of the following:

(i)

the parking is a shared parking facility, and the site plan includes a note that identifies
the shared parking facility as a condition of approval;

(ii)

the parking is rented or sold separately from the building space, and the site plan
includes a note that identifies the separate rental or sale of the parking spaces
as a condition of approval;

(iii)

the parking is designed and constructed for conversion to usable building space in
the future, and the site plan includes a note that identifies the ability to convert
the parking to usable building space as a condition of approval;

the parking is included in an underground parking structure; or

(v)

the applicant pays a mitigation fee established by separate ordinance.

(4)

The street impact fee study shall be adopted by separate ordinance.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The city manager shall establish accounting controls to ensure compliance with Section
395.024 of the Texas Local Government Code.

(B)

The city manager shall establish separate interest-bearing accounts for street impact
fees collected for each street impact fee service area.

(C)

Funds may be disbursed as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this article
within a reasonable period, but not to exceed 10 years from the date the street impact
fee is deposited into the account.

(D)

The city manager will keep financial records for street impact fees showing the source
and disbursement of all street impact fees collected in or expended from each service
area.

(E)

The street impact fees collected may be used to:

(1)

finance, pay for, or recoup the costs of any roadway facility identified in the roadway
capacity plan for the service area;

(2)

pay for the contract services of an independent qualified engineer or financial consultant;
or

(3)

pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes, or other
obligations issued by or on behalf of the City to finance such capital improvements.

(F)

After ten years have passed from the date of payment of a street impact fee, the record
owner of the property or governmental entity that paid the original street impact
fee may apply for a proportional refund of any street impact fees that have not been
expended within the service area within such period. Street impact fees shall be considered
expended on a first in, first out basis. The application for a refund must be submitted
to the City within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period. The refund
shall include interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund
at the statutory rate as set forth in Texas Finance Code Section 302.002, or its successor
statute.

The city manager shall collect the street impact fee on new development in accordance
with this article and Chapter 395 of the Texas Local Government Code.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

Assessment of the street impact fee for any new development shall occur:

(1)

on December 21, 2020, if the final plat approval occurred before December 21, 2020;

(2)

at the time of final plat approval if the development has not received plat approval;
or

(3)

at the time an application is submitted for a building permit for development that
is exempted from platting under Section 25-4-2 (Exemption from Platting Requirements).

(B)

For a development that has been assessed a street impact fee under Section 25-6-662(A)(1), the street impact fee shall be reassessed if the owner submits a new application
for plat approval.

(C)

An application for an amended plat shall not be subject to reassessment for an impact
fee.

(D)

All assessments of street impact fees shall be the amount of the maximum street impact
fee per service unit as set forth in adopted street impact fee study in effect.

(E)

The amount of the maximum street impact fee for a new development, less any applicable
percentage reduction in fees attributable to internal recapture, transit proximity,
or parking management techniques under Section 25-6-667 (Mobility Related Reductions), may be considered by the director's designated engineer as an appropriate measure
of the new development's demand for roadway system facilities under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality of Required Infrastructure). The amount of street impact fees assessed may be used in evaluating any claim by
an applicant that the infrastructure improvements required in conjunction with approval
of the development application are not roughly proportionate to the proposed development.
To the extent that the street impact fee collected from a new development is less
than the maximum impact fee per service unit, except for reductions under Section 25-6-667 (Mobility Related Reductions), such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement
of the impacts of the new development on the City's roadway system.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The amount of the street impact fee to be assessed for each service unit and the amount
of the street impact fee to be collected for each service unit shall be set by separate
ordinance. The street impact fee to be collected may be increased by ordinance prior
to the next scheduled street impact fee update without amending the street impact
fee study, provided that the impact fee to be collected does not exceed the street
impact fee that was assessed.

(B)

A street impact fee shall be collected at the time of the issuance of a building permit.

(C)

The city manager may enter into an agreement with a developer for a different time
and manner of payment of street impact fees.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The City shall compute the amount of street impact fees to be paid and collected for
new development in the following manner:

(1)

Determine the number of development units for each land use category using the LUVMET
then in effect.

(2)

Multiply the number of development units for each land use category in the new development
by the service unit for each corresponding land use category in the LUVMET to determine
the number of service units attributable to the new development.

(3)

Multiply the number of service units for the new development by the street impact
fee per service unit to be collected for the applicable service area and applicable
land use.

(B)

If an agreement as described in City Code Section 25-6-669 (Offsets Against Street Impact Fees) providing for offsets exists, the amount of the offsets shall be deducted from the
street impact fees as calculated above.

(C)

If the applicant proposes to increase the number of service units for a development
that has already paid a street impact fee, the additional street impact fees collected
for such new service units shall be determined by using the LUVMET.

(D)

Any additional street impact fees shall be measured by the increase in the number
of service units proposed from the number of service units from the preceding land
use within the last five years.

(E)

If a building permit application is for a speculative building, the amount of the
street impact fee shall be calculated assuming that the entire building will be used
as either "General Office", "Light Industrial", or "Shopping Center" as shown in the
LUVMET. When a subsequent application for a building permit is submitted, an additional
street impact fee shall be calculated if the proposed use results in an increase of
service units.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

If an equivalent land use is not found in the LUVMET for the proposed development,
an applicant may submit an alternative service unit computation, based upon a trip
generation study as defined by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The director
may use the alternative service unit computation to calculate the street impact fee.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The City may reduce the amount of street impact fees assessed if the new development
qualifies for and the applicant requests a reduction under Section 25-6-667 (Mobility Related Reductions) or 25-6-668 (Affordability Related Reductions). The burden of qualifying for a reduction is on the applicant.

(B)

New development that qualifies for the maximum reduction under each provision may
reduce the amount of street impact fees due up to one hundred percent.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

For new developments with an accepted transportation analysis demonstrating that the
internal capture will reduce the number of trips from the trip counts calculated from
the adopted LUVMET, the amount of street impact fees shall be reduced according to
the following table:

| Trip Capture | Street Impact Fee Reduction |
| --- | --- |
| 5% - 9% | 5% |
| 10% - 14% | 10% |
| 15% - 19% | 15% |
| 20% or greater | 20% |

(B)

The amount of street impact fees may be reduced by up to the maximums shown in the
table below for any new development that utilizes an accepted transportation demand
management plan per the Transportation Criteria Manual.

| TDM Category | Service Area DT OR UNO District | Service Areas F, I, J, L, parts of K | All other Service Areas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transit Proximity | 20% | 10% | 5% |
| Parking | 20% | 10% | 5% |

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

An applicant who complies with the requirements of this section may request a 100
percent reduction of the street impact fee for all service units that meet the requirements
in Subsection (B).

(B)

To be eligible for a reduction under this section, affordable housing must be a housing
unit located within the corporate limits of the City that is:

(1)

approved for local, state, or federal funding for affordable housing as verified by
the director of the Housing and Planning Department; or

(2)

certified by the director of the Housing and Planning Department under another affordable
housing program of City Code that meets the requirements of this section.

(C)

To retain a reduction under this section, a unit of affordable housing must comply
with the requirements of this subsection.

(1)

A rental unit must be available for occupancy for a period of not less than 40 years
by an occupant whose gross household income does not exceed 60 percent of the median
family income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

(2)

An owner-occupied unit must be available for occupancy for a period of not less than
99 years by an occupant whose gross household income does not exceed 80 percent of
the median family income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

(3)

An affordability period prescribed by this subsection begins on the date that an affordable
unit is available for occupancy.

(D)

An applicant who requests a reduction under this section must submit an application
to the director of the Housing and Planning Department demonstrating compliance.

(E)

If the director of the Housing and Planning Department certifies that a proposed development
meets the requirements of this division, the accountable official is authorized to
process a development application.

(F)

Before the director of the Housing and Planning Department may certify that a proposed
development meets the requirements of this section, the applicant shall execute:

(1)

an agreement to preserve the minimum affordability period and related requirements
imposed by this division; and

(2)

a document for recording in the real property records that provides notice of or preserves
the minimum affordability requirements imposed by this division.

(3)

The form of the documents described in this section must be approved by the city attorney.

(G)

If an applicant who receives a reduction under this section does not comply with Subsection
(B), defaults on its obligations under documents executed under Subsection (C), or
does not perform in accordance with the conditions for receipt of the reduction, the
City may initiate legal proceedings to recover the street impact fees that would have
applied to the housing unit and damages.

(H)

A reduction under this section may not be assigned or transferred by the applicant
to another property.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The City may offset the improvements or funding for construction of any system facility
included on the roadway capacity plan that is required or agreed to by the City under
this section and administrative guidelines.

(1)

The roadway facility shall be associated with the plat or other detailed plan of development
for the property that is to be served by the roadway facility.

(2)

No offset shall be given for the dedication, funding, or construction of site-related
facilities.

(3)

No offset shall be given for a roadway facility which is not identified within the
roadway capacity plan unless the system facility qualifies for inclusion on the roadway
capacity plan and is incorporated within an allocation agreement with the City under
Subsection (D).

(4)

The value of any offset for a system facility shall be reduced by the City's cost
participation in the construction or funding of such facility.

(5)

If the amount of the offsets for a new development exceeds the total amount of street
impact fees due for the development, the remaining amount of the offsets may not be
transferred or assigned to other new developments for which street impact fees are
due, nor is the City responsible for reimbursing the property owner for such remaining
amount, unless an allocation agreement under Subsection (D) expressly so provides.

(B)

No offsets shall be granted for the onsite dedication of rights-of-way or easements
required by this chapter. Onsite dedication of rights-of-way or easements for roadway
system facilities may be considered in determining the development's share of roadway
infrastructure improvement costs under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality of Required Infrastructure).

(C)

Construction of capital improvements must be completed and accepted by the City in
order to qualify as an offset with the following limitations:

(1)

Construction completed and accepted before December 21, 2020, will only qualify as
an offset until December 21, 2030.

(2)

Construction that begins after December 21, 2020, will qualify as an offset for ten
years from the date the improvement is completed and accepted by the City unless the
applicant is granted an extension.

(D)

Before street impact fees can be reduced by offsets authorized under this section,
the owner of the property shall enter into an agreement with the City determining
the allocation of the offsets. Unless the allocation agreement specifies otherwise,
an offset associated with a plat shall be applied when the first building permit is
submitted and to each subsequent building permit application to reduce street impact
fees due until the amount associated with the offset is exhausted.

(E)

Master planned projects, including subdivisions containing multiple phases, whether
approved before or after the effective date of the street impact fee regulations,
may apply for offsets against street impact fees for the entire project based upon
improvements or funds toward construction of system facilities. For projects where
development has already occurred, the amount of any offset shall be reduced by the
value attributable to any service units for which a building permit has been issued
prior to one year from the effective date of this article. Offsets shall be spent
within the same service area using a methodology approved by the City and incorporated
within an agreement under Subsection (D).

(F)

For new development that consists of multiple phases, the City may require that total
offsets be proportionally allocated among phases within the new development.

Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.

(A)

The property owner or applicant for a new development may appeal the following administrative
decisions to the Land Use Commission:

(1)

The applicability of a street impact fee to the development;

(2)

The amount of the street impact fee due;

(3)

The availability of, the amount of, or the expiration of an offset;

(4)

The application of an offset against a street impact fee due;

(5)

The amount of a refund due, if any; or

(6)

The availability of a reduction against the collection of street impact fees.

The people of the City declare their intent to preserve a clean and safe drinking
water supply, to prevent further degradation of the water quality in Barton Creek,
Barton Springs, and the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer, to provide for fair, consistent,
and cost effective administration of the City's watershed protection ordinances, and
to promote the public health, safety, and welfare. The City recognizes that the Barton
Springs Edwards Aquifer is more vulnerable to pollution from urban development than
any other major groundwater supply in Texas, and that the measures set out in this
article are necessary to protect this irreplaceable natural resource.

(A)

In the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, no development nor any revision,
extension, or amendment thereof, may be approved unless it is designed, carried out,
and maintained on a site-by-site basis to meet the pollution prevention requirements
set forth below for the life of the project. In order to prevent pollution, impervious
cover for all such development shall be limited to a maximum of 15 percent in the
entire recharge zone, 20 percent of the contributing zone within the Barton Creek
watershed, and 25 percent in the remainder of the contributing zone. The impervious
cover limits shall be calculated on a net site area basis. In addition, runoff from
such development shall be managed through water quality controls and onsite pollution
prevention and assimilation techniques so that no increases occur in the respective
average annual loadings of total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total nitrogen,
chemical oxygen demand, total lead, cadmium, E. coli, volatile organic compounds,
pesticides, and herbicides from the site. For a given project, impervious cover shall
be reduced if needed to assure compliance with these pollutant load restrictions.

(B)

Within the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, Section 25-8-92 (Critical Water Quality Zones Established) of the Land Development Code is amended so that in no event shall the boundary of
the critical water quality zone be less than 200 feet from the centerline of a major
waterway or be less than 400 feet from the centerline of the main channel of Barton
Creek. No pollution control structure, or residential or commercial building, may
be constructed in the critical water quality zone in these watersheds.

## CHAPTER 25-10. - SIGN REGULATIONS.

(A)

This chapter establishes a comprehensive system for the regulation of signs within
the City of Austin and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, to serve the following purposes:

(1)

To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the City and its residents and
to implement the policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan.

(2)

To allow adequate opportunity for free speech in the form of messages or images displayed
on signs, while balancing that interest against public safety and aesthetic concerns
impacted by signs.

(3)

To ensure that the design, location, construction, illumination, installation, repair,
and maintenance of signs:

(a)

Does not interfere with traffic safety or otherwise endanger public safety;

(b)

Enhances and protects the aesthetic value of the City by reducing visual clutter that
is potentially harmful to property values, economic development, and quality of life;
and

(c)

Is consistent with the character of districts in which the signs are located, including
areas specially designated for historic, scenic or architectural value.

(4)

To protect the safety and efficiency of the City's transportation system by reducing
confusion and distractions to pedestrians and motorists, while enhancing motorists'
ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, other vehicles, and traffic signs.

(5)

Recognizing the unique impact of off-premise advertising on public safety, visual
aesthetics, and quality of life, to restrict new off-premise signs and minimize the
impact of existing off-premise signs.

(6)

To prevent the inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech,
or favoring of any particular non-commercial speech over any other non-commercial
speech based on its content.

(B)

The requirements of this chapter apply to signs within the planning jurisdiction.

first placed and includes pouring a slab or footing, installing pilings, or constructing
columns. Permanent construction does not include preparing land (clearing, excavating,
grading, or filing); installing streets or walkways; excavating for a basement, footing,
pier, or foundation; or erecting temporary forms or installing accessory buildings
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial
improvement, construction starts when a wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building is altered even if the alteration does not affect the external
dimensions of the building.

(19)

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before-damage condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(20)

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. For the purpose of determining compliance with the flood hazard management provisions
of the Building Code, a substantial improvement is any combination of repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, alteration, addition or other improvement of a building or structure
during the immediate 10-year period, the cost of which cumulatively equals or exceeds
50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include either of the following:

1.

Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary
or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions.

2.

Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude
the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; for the purpose of
this exclusion, a historic building is a building that is:

a.

listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places; or

b.

determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as contributing
to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily
determined to qualify as a historic district; or

c.

designated as historic under a State of Texas or local historic preservation program
that is approved by the Department of the Interior.

(22)

VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction
in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would
result in unnecessary hardship.

(B)

A term defined in an article in this chapter has the same meaning in this article.

of the size, configuration or topography of the site;

(b)

a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship
by rendering the lot undevelopable;

(c)

a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances;

(d)

a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief; and

(e)

notification to the applicant in writing over the signature of the building official
that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.

1503.6 Prohibited location. A gray water system is not allowed on a site the authority having jurisdiction determines
has insufficient lot area or has inappropriate soil conditions that will not adequately
absorb the gray water to prevent ponding, surfacing, or run off. A gray water system
is not allowed in the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone or in any other area the Authority
Having Jurisdiction determines is geologically sensitive.

1503.10 Laundry to landscape system.

1503.10.1 General. This section applies when installing, altering, or repairing a laundry to landscape
systems.

New Construction. A gravity gray water drainage system shall be installed in new construction in one-
and two-family dwellings constructed after January 1, 2025, for future use. A gray
water system shall be installed to allow for the separate discharge of gray water
for direct landscape irrigation from a cloth washing machine installed adjacent to
an exterior wall or a wall perpendicular to an exterior wall.

Exception: Where soil conditions do not provide adequate infiltration, where setbacks cannot
be maintained, or other such limitations are prohibited by the Land Development Code.
Project applicants shall submit documentation satisfactory to the Authority Having
Jurisdiction for an exemption.

1503.10.2 System design. A laundry to landscape system must be designed:

1.

To divert gray water from a domestic laundry washing-machine located in a private
one- or two-family dwelling only;

2.

To allow the private residence, using one-inch tubing, to direct the flow of gray
water from the domestic laundry washing-machine to an irrigation field for landscape
irrigation or to divert to the building sewer;

3.

To include a manifold with a one-inch, three-way accessible diverter valve. The valve
to be located in an accessible location and be identified as a gray water system;

4.

So that the three-way diverter valve and piping is supported to relieve any potential
stress on the piping when in use;

5.

So that all gray water is contained to the site where it is generated without ponding,
surfacing, or run off;

6.

To minimize contact with humans and domestic pets; and

7.

So that it does not constitute a health nuisance.

8.

With an informational card at least four by six inches in size and containing information
specified by Austin Water about the usage of laundry to landscape plumbing which shall
be affixed adjacent to the three-way diverter valve.

9.

With gray water piping and stub out(s) clearly identified with a label having a purple
(Pantone color No. 512, 522C, or equivalent) background and black uppercase lettering.
Labeling shall be field, or factory marked as follows: "CAUTION: NONPOTABLE GRAY WATER,
DO NOT DRINK"; and

10.

For new construction one- and two-family dwellings:

a.

The inlet of the three-way valve will require a direct connection from the washing
machine drain outlet.

b.

Outlet one of the three-way valve will terminate no more than four inches into the
washing machine standpipe.

c.

Outlet two of the three-way valve will require an air admittance valve then the stub
out will terminate outside above finish grade or be located in a valve box when below
grade, for future use. Both stub out methods must be labeled with black letters in
a purple background.

d.

The standpipe trap will require periodic use for the purpose of maintaining a water
level in the trap to prevent sewer gas release.

1503.10.4 Discharge. The laundry to landscape system may discharge to a subsurface irrigation system,
a subsoil irrigation system, or mulch basin. Above ground discharge is prohibited.

1503.10.5 Uses. The laundry to landscape system may be used to irrigate landscape on the exterior
of the structure but may not be used to irrigate root crops or food crops that come
in contact with soil and are intended for human consumption.

1503.10.6 Prohibited locations. A laundry to landscape system is not allowed on a site that exceeds a three to one
slope. A laundry to landscape system must comply with Sections 1503.10.4 and 1503.10.6.

1503.10.7 Connections to plumbing systems. A laundry to landscape system does not authorize a person to cut into or make any
permanent physical attachment to the plumbing system. A laundry to landscape system
may not include a change to, alteration of, or repair of any potable water connection;
may not include any other pump installation, other than the pump equipped with, or
manufactured as part of the domestic laundry-washing machine; and may not affect or
alter any other building, plumbing, electrical, or mechanical components such as structural
features, egress, fire-life safety, sanitation, potable water supply piping, or accessibility
to the property.

1503.10.8 Permits and inspections. It is unlawful for a person to construct, install, alter, or cause to be constructed,
installed, or altered a laundry to landscape system in a building or premise without
first obtaining a permit to do such work from the Authority Having Jurisdiction.

1505.5 Initial cross-connection test. Before a building is occupied or the system is activated, a cross-connection test
that complies with Section 1502.3 is required. Final approval cannot be granted until
the test is deemed successful by the Authority Having Jurisdiction.

1505.10 Hose Bibs. Hose bibs shall not be allowed on reclaimed (recycled) water piping systems. Access
to reclaimed (recycled) water shall be through a quick-disconnect device that differs
from those installed on the potable water system. Such outlets supplying reclaimed
(recycled) water shall be marked with the words: "CAUTION: NONPOTABLE RECLAIMED WATER,
DO NOT DRINK" and the symbol in Figure 1505.10.

APPENDIX D. FUEL MODELS

As set forth in Section 3.2.1 of the Austin-Travis County Community Wildfire Protection
Plan, fuel loads and fire behavior within the region are indicated by the following
vegetation:

1.

Sparse, dry-climate grass, or grassland, is dominated by generally short grasses that
may be sparse or discontinuous (Scott and Burgan 2005). Pastures are also considered
grasslands.

2.

Aggrading juniper shrub fuel type is dominated by live oak-juniper and juniper savanna.
It is present throughout the county. It includes both Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), predominantly in western Travis County, and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), predominately in eastern Travis County. Juniper scorch and mortality values by size
class are nearly identical between these two Juniperus species (Engle and Stritzke
1995).

3.

Closed juniper woodland has sufficient canopy closure to limit growth of tall grass
(18 inches or more tall) to less than 50 percent of the ground cover. Juniper, including
Ashe juniper and/or eastern redcedar, and deciduous trees are the dominant vegetation
types.

4.

Mixed juniper hardwood forest fuel type is 25-percent juniper, 75-percent deciduous
class.

The following provisions are local amendments to the 2024 International Property Maintenance
Code. Each provision of this section is a substitute for any identically numbered
provision of the 2024 International Property Maintenance Code deleted by Section 25-12-211(B) (Property Maintenance Code) or is an addition to the 2024 International Property Maintenance Code.

101.1 Title. These regulations are known as the City of Austin Property Maintenance Code and are
referred to as the "Property Maintenance Code" or "this code."

102.3 Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, must be
done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of Title 25
(Land Development Code).

103.1 General. The City Manager must designate the department or departments charged with enforcement
of this code.

103.2 Designation. The City Manager must designate a code official.

103.3 Inspectors. The code official may designate inspectors to assist with enforcement of this code.
Such employees must have powers and duties delegated by the code official.

104.1 Costs. The City may assess a property owner for costs incurred to demolish, board, fence,
secure, vacate, relocate occupants, repair, treat, remediate or similar action identified
in this code. This includes the costs incurred because a property owner fails to comply
with a Commission order. Unless exempted by the Texas Constitution, the expense incurred
by the City under this code may be recorded as a lien against the real property on
which the building, structure, or noncompliant condition is located, with interest
on the unpaid balance to accrue at the maximum rate allowed by law.

104.2 Funds. Unless otherwise provided for or directed by a Commission order, a cost incurred
by the city or its agent to repair, remediate, vacate, relocate occupants from, secure,
or clean a structure, building, or property because an owner fails to comply with
a Commission order must be paid from demolition funds budgeted by the city council.

105.2 Inspections. The code official is authorized to make inspections and may consider written inspection
reports prepared and certified by approved agencies or individuals. The code official
is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual
technical issues that arise.

105.3 Right of Entry. Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this
code, or whenever the code official has reasonable or probable cause to believe that
a violation exists in a structure or upon a premises, the code official is authorized
to enter the structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or perform the duties
authorized by this code or City Code. An owner or other authorized individual may
refuse to consent to an inspection conducted by the code official. If consent is refused,
the code official may seek an administrative search warrant authorized by Article
18 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Search Warrants) and City Code Section 2-10-1 (Jurisdiction and Authority). Nothing in this code limits the ability of the code official to inspect as necessary
or as authorized by other law.

105.8 Commencement of Proceedings. Whenever the code official finds that a structure or premise is substandard or dangerous,
the code official is authorized to begin proceedings to cause the repair, rehabilitation,
vacation, demolition, removal, boarding or fencing or other means of closure of the
building, structure, or premise.

105.9 Corrective Action. The code official is authorized to require the owner of the property or other responsible
person to take action to correct a violation of this code. If the owner or other responsible
person does not take corrective action within a specified time period, the code official
may serve notice to the person(s) to appear before the Building and Standards Commission
to show cause why the structure or premise should not be ordered repaired, boarded,
fenced, vacated, occupants relocated, or demolished.

106.1 Appeal. A person affected by a notice may appeal the violation findings contained in the
notice to the Building and Standards Commission.

106.2 Deadline to Appeal. An appeal must be submitted to the code official within 20 days from the date the
notice is mailed by the City. It is presumed the City mailed the notice on the date
printed on the notice.

106.3 Requirements. An appeal must be in writing and must contain a brief statement identifying the notice
or action being appealed, setting forth any facts supporting the appeal, describing
the relief sought, and presenting the reasons why the appealed notice or action should
be reversed, modified or otherwise set aside. A request for additional time to comply
with the notice due to financial inability or other extenuating circumstance is not
a proper basis for appeal.

106.4 Effect of an appeal. Unless otherwise provided in this code or, in the opinion of the code official, a
delay would present an immediate danger or unreasonable risk to any person or property,
filing an appeal stays further City action under the notice being appealed.

107.1 Unlawful acts. A person that fails to comply with this code, a notice of violation issued under
this code, or an order issued under this code commits an offense.

107.3 Prosecution of a violation. A violation of this code is a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in City Code Section 25-1-462
(Criminal Enforcement). The filing of a criminal action does not preclude the pursuit of a civil, quasi-judicial,
or administrative action for violation of this code.

108.4 Criminal Offense and Penalty. A person commits an offense if the person fails to comply with a stop work order
issued by the code official. Each day that a person fails to comply with a stop work
order is a separate occurrence. An offense under this section is a class C misdemeanor.
The maximum penalty must be $500 per offense, per occurrence. Proof of a culpable
mental state is not required for conviction of an offense under this section.

109.1 General. When the code official finds a structure, premise, or equipment is unsafe, is unfit
for human occupancy, or is unlawful, such structure, premise, or equipment must be
subject to the provisions of this code. If the code official finds a structure unsafe,
the owner of the property shall provide an action plan for repairs to the code official
and provide approved accommodations for the occupants of the structure within two
days of receiving notice.

109.1.3 Structure Unsafe for Human Occupancy. A structure is unfit for human occupancy whenever the code official finds that such
structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is
in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is insanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains
filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary, cooling facilities
or heating facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because
the location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure
or to the public. If the code official finds a structure unsafe, the owner of the
property shall provide an action plan for repairs to the code official and provide
approved accommodations for the occupants of the structure within two days of receiving
notice.

109.2 Closing of vacant structures. If a structure is determined to be unsafe, dangerous, or unfit for human habitation,
the code official is authorized to post an unsafe or dangerous placard on the premises
and shall order the structure to be secured so as not to be an attractive nuisance
through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private persons.
The cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure
is located and shall be recorded as a lien upon such real estate and shall be collected
by any other legal resource.

109.2.1 Utility Termination Authorized. The code official may request utility termination for a structure or premise as provided
for under the applicable provisions of state law and City Code. Provisions of state
law and City Code regarding notice and appeal of utility termination apply to a utility

grounds to believe that a violation exists, notice will be issued and served as set
forth in applicable state law, City Code, and this code. Failure of the code official
to serve any person required to be served does not invalidate any proceedings as to
any other person properly served or relieve that person from any duty or obligation
imposed by this code.

109.4.1 Form. A written notice directed to the owner of record and, if applicable, occupant of
the structure or premise notice must:

1.

to the manager of the property. On receipt of a copy of the notice under this section,
a property manager must notify the owner of the specifics of the notice within 10
days and must make every reasonable effort to have the owner correct the violation.

109.6 Responsibility of Owner. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling unit or structure who has received
a compliance order or upon whom a notice of violation has been served to sell, transfer,
mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of such dwelling unit or structure to another
until the provisions of the compliance order or notice of violation have been complied
with, or until such owner or the owner's authorized agent shall first furnish the
grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any compliance order or notice
of violation issued by the code official.

109.6.1 Responsibility of Purchaser. A purchaser of a premise subject to a notice, order, or other notification issued
under this code and recorded in the real property records of the county where the
property is located must comply with the terms of the notice, order, or other notification.

109.6.2 Effect of Transfer. A transfer of the property does not impact the validity of the notice, order, or
other notification.

109.6.3 Duty to comply. A person has a duty to comply with the provisions, requirements, and prohibitions
in this code even if the code official has not served the person with separate notice
personally informing the person of the duty to comply with this code.

109.7 Placarding. A structure or premise vacated under this code will be placarded at each entrance
and exit of the structure or premise. The placard must be in substantially the following
form:

or premise.

110.2 Temporary Safeguards. The code official may secure a structure before a public hearing is held by the Commission

with this chapter and other applicable laws. For the purpose of making inspections,
the code official or the code official's representative may enter, examine, and survey,
at all reasonable times, all buildings, dwelling units, guest rooms, and premises
on presentation of the proper credentials. An owner or other authorized individual
may refuse to consent to an inspection conducted by the code official. If consent
is refused, that refusal is grounds for suspension of any current license, or denial
of any license renewal associated with or assigned to that boarding house, hotel,
or bed and breakfast establishment. The code official may seek an administrative search
warrant authorized by Article 18 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Search Warrant) and City Code Section 2-10-1 (Jurisdiction and Authority). Nothing in this code limits the ability of the code official to inspect as necessary
or as authorized by other law.

1302 Licenses and permits required. No person may operate a boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment
unless a license for the operation, in the name of the owner or operator and for the
specific dwelling unit, partial unit, accessory unit, building, structure, or property
used, has been issued by the code official and is currently valid and in good standing.
Unless specifically exempted by the provisions of Chapter 10-3 (Food and Food Handlers), each regulated lodging establishment that provides meals or food service is required
to have a permit as a food service establishment issued by the Health Authority.

1303 Leasing, renting, or advertising units or rooms in an unlicensed hotel, boarding
house, or bed and breakfast establishment is an offense.

(A)

An owner, manager, operator, or person in control of a hotel, boarding house, or bed
and breakfast establishment commits an offense if the owner or other person leases,
rents, advertises, promotes, or otherwise solicits or induces occupancy of a room,
structure, dwelling unit, or partial unit in a hotel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast
establishment which does not have a valid license issued and displayed as required
by this chapter or as required by Title 25
(Land Development).

(B)

A person may not advertise or promote a licensed establishment without including the
license number assigned to the establishment by the city in the advertisement or promotion.

(C)

Each day that an owner, manager, operator, or other person in control of the property
leases, rents, advertises, promotes, or otherwise solicits or induces occupancy of
a room in a hotel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment which does not
have a valid license issued, disclosed, and displayed as required by this chapter
is a separate occurrence. An offense under this section is a class C misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine not to exceed $500 per offense, per occurrence, unless proof
of a culpable mental state is proven. If proof of a culpable mental state is demonstrated,
an offense under this section is punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000 per occurrence.

(D)

It is an affirmative defense to a violation of Section 1303 if the advertisement or
promotion conspicuously disclosed that reservation, occupancy, or rental of the facility
is contingent on a pending city licensure application.

1304 Application. An application for a license required by this chapter must be in writing and submitted
to the code official. To be considered complete, the application must include all
information and documentation required by the Land Development Code regulations specific
to the use type or indicated as required by the code official and this code.

1305 Fee. Each application for a hotel, motel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment
license must be accompanied by the payment of a fee in an amount established by separate
ordinance. A regulated lodging establishment fee must be prorated on a quarterly basis.

1306 Issuance. A boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment license must be issued
by the code official after the code official determines that the owner or operator
has complied with all applicable ordinances and rules. A license must not be issued
or renewed by the code official for any applicant or location in the absence of proof
of the applicant or location's substantial compliance with all applicable local hotel
occupancy tax rules and regulations.

1307 License suspension.

(A)

Except as provided in subsection (D), whenever the code official finds on inspection
of the physical premises or review of applicable records of any boarding house, hotel,
or bed and breakfast establishment that conditions or practices exist that violate
any provision of the Property Maintenance Code, City Code, or any rule or regulation
adopted under this code, or that the establishment has failed to comply with any provision,
prohibition, or requirement related to the registration, reporting, collection, segregation,
accounting, disclosure, or payment of local hotel occupancy taxes, the code official
must give written notice to the owner of the property and the operator of the boarding
house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment that unless the violations are corrected
by an identified deadline, the license must be suspended.

gas, mechanical or plumbing installation, and minor building alterations and repairs,
the building official is authorized to issue an annual permit upon application therefor
to any person, firm or corporation regularly employing one or more qualified trade
persons in the building, structure or on the premises owned or operated by the applicant
for the permit. The facility shall maintain records on all work performed under the
annual permit in accordance with Section 105.1.2 (Annual Permit Records).

design flood elevations; and it shall be drawn in accordance with an accurate boundary
line survey. In the case of demolition, the site plan shall show construction to be
demolished and the location and size of existing structures and construction that
are to remain on the site or plot. For a building or structure involving below-grade
construction, the site plan shall show the location of proposed earth retention system
components allowed under Section 3202.1.4 (Earth Retention System Components) of the Building Code. The building official is authorized to waive or modify the
requirement of the site plan when the application for permit is for alteration, repair
or change of occupancy when otherwise warranted.

111.3 Authority to Disconnect Service Utilities. The building official shall have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility
service to the building, structure or system regulated by this code and the referenced
codes and standards in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate

R202 Definitions

HEIGHT, BUILDING has the same meaning as "height" as defined in City Code Section 25-1-21
(Definitions).

START OF CONSTRUCTION means the date a permit is issued for new construction or substantial improvements
to existing structures if construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement starts within 180 days from the date the permit is
issued. Construction starts when permanent construction of a building (including a
manufactured home) is first placed and includes pouring a slab or footing, installing
pilings, or constructing columns. Permanent construction does not include preparing
land (clearing, excavating, grading, or filing); installing streets or walkways; excavating
for a basement, footing, pier, or foundation, erecting temporary forms or installing
accessory buildings not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building.
For a substantial improvement, construction starts when a wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building is altered even if the alteration does not affect
the external dimensions of the building.

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means an amount of damage that results in restoration costs that equal or exceed
50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any combination of repairs, alterations, reconstructions, rehabilitations,
additions, or improvements to a building or structure during the immediate 10-year
period with cumulative costs that equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of
the structure before the improvement or repair is started or, if the structure was
damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. If the structure has sustained
substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless
of the actual repair work performed. Substantial improvement does not include:

1.

an improvement required to correct existing health, sanitary, safety code violations
identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe
living conditions; or

2.

an alteration to a historic structure if the alteration will not disqualify the structure
from continuing its designation as a historic structure, which means a structure that
is listed or preliminarily determined eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places, determined by the Secretary of the United States Department of
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district,
or a district preliminarily determined to qualify as a historic district, or designated
as historic under a State of Texas or local historic preservation program that is
approved by the United States Department of the Interior.

SURCHARGE means the vertical load imposed on retained soil that may impose a lateral force
in addition to the lateral earth pressure of retained soil.

subdividing only a portion of the original tract will not substantially impair the
orderly planning of roads, utilities, drainage, and other public facilities;

access to a public street, or the applicant has provided access to a public street
by dedicating right-of-way at least 50 feet wide;

the owner must plat the land before the city may approve a development permit or a
utility company may provide initial or additional service.

of the original tract is possible, the single office may require that the applicant
provide a schematic land plan of the balance of the original tract. The single office
may not require that the applicant provide detailed engineering information.

An applicant who satisfies the requirement of Subsection (D)(2) by dedicating right-of-way
to provide access to a public street is not required to construct improvements within
the right-of-way.

the phasing agreement accommodates the development and protects the public interest;

(b)

the dedication of roads, drainage facilities, parkland, and other infrastructure and
the posting of construction security is roughly proportional to the impact of the
development of the property; and

![](https://mcclibrary.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/codecontent/15303/477741/30-2-214-C.png)

(D)

In calculating the amount of parkland to be dedicated under this section, the number
of residents in each dwelling unit is based on density as follows:

| Dwelling Units Per Acre | Residents In Each Dwelling Unit |
| --- | --- |
| Not more than 6 | 2.8 |
| Dwelling Units Per Acre | Residents In Each Dwelling Unit |
| More than 6 and not more than 12 | 2.2 |
| More than 12 | 1.7 |

(E)

In calculating the amount of parkland to be dedicated under this section, density
for a multifamily subdivision is assumed to be the highest permitted in the zoning
district, or if the property is not zoned, 24 dwelling units per acre. The subdivider
may reduce the assumed density by restricting density in a restrictive covenant enforceable
by the park service provider and approved by the park service provider's attorney.

within the 25-year floodplain, if any, is also dedicated as parkland. The land within
the 25-year floodplain may not be credited toward fulfilling the requirements of this
part.

(D)

Land identified on the Critical Areas Map maintained by the Watershed Protection and
Development Review Department that does not otherwise comply with the standards for
parkland dedication may be accepted as dedicated parkland if the director determines
that the land will provide recreational or educational opportunities for the surrounding
community. In this event, 50 percent of the acreage may be credited toward fulfilling
the requirements of this part.

(A)

The director may require a subdivider to deposit with the park service provider a
cash payment or fiscal security instead of the dedication of parkland if:

(1)

less than six acres is required to be dedicated; or

(2)

the land available for dedication does not comply with the standards for dedication.

(B)

A deposit is calculated by multiplying the number of acres of parkland required to
be dedicated by the average value of an acre of land in the subdivision. The average
value of an acre of land in the subdivision is calculated by dividing the fair market
value of the land in the subdivision by the number of acres in the subdivision. To
make this calculation, the subdivider may select one of the following fair market
value determinations:

(1)

the current fair market value of the land as shown on the records of the tax appraisal
district;

(2)

the current fair market value of the land as determined by a qualified real estate
appraiser at the subdivider's expense, if the director approves the appraiser and
certifies that the appraisal fairly reflects the land value; or

(3)

the current fair market value of the land as determined by a qualified real estate
appraiser employed by the park service provider.

(C)

A deposit must be placed in the park service provider's park improvement fund. The
deposit must be used for the acquisition or improvement of parks that will benefit
the residents of the subdivision and that are located in the service area defined
by the park service provider.

(D)

The park service provider shall expend a deposit within five years from the date it
is received. This period is extended by five years if, at the expiration of the initial
five year period, less than 50 percent of the residential units in the subdivision
have been constructed.

(E)

If the park service provider does not expend a deposit by the deadline described in
Subsection (D), and the actual number of residential units constructed is less than
the number assumed at the time the deposit was calculated, the owner may request a
refund. The request must be in writing and filed with the director not later than
180 days after the expiration of the time period described in Subsection (D). A refund
is calculated by multiplying the percentage of the reduction in the number of residential
units times the amount of the deposit. A refund may not exceed the unexpended amount
of a deposit.

The people of the City declare their intent to preserve a clean and safe drinking
water supply, to prevent further degradation of the water quality in Barton Creek,
Barton Springs, and the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer, to provide for fair, consistent,
and cost effective administration of the City's watershed protection ordinances, and
to promote the public health, safety, and welfare. The City recognizes that the Barton
Springs Edwards Aquifer is more vulnerable to pollution from urban development than
any other major groundwater supply in Texas, and that the measures set out in this
article are necessary to protect this irreplaceable natural resource.

(A)

In the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, no development nor any revision,
extension, or amendment thereof, may be approved unless it is designed, carried out,
and maintained on a site-by-site basis to meet the pollution prevention requirements
set forth below for the life of the project. In order to prevent pollution, impervious
cover for all such development shall be limited to a maximum of 15 percent in the
entire recharge zone, 20 percent of the contributing zone within the Barton Creek
watershed, and 25 percent in the remainder of the contributing zone. The impervious
cover limits shall be calculated on a net site area basis. In addition, runoff from
such development shall be managed through water quality controls and onsite pollution
prevention and assimilation techniques so that no increases occur in the respective
average annual loadings of total suspended solids, total phosphorus, total nitrogen,
chemical oxygen demand, total lead, cadmium, E. coli., volatile organic compounds,
pesticides, and herbicides from the site. For a given project, impervious cover shall
be reduced if needed to assure compliance with these pollutant load restrictions.

(B)

Within the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, Section 25-8-92 (Critical Water Quality Zones Established) of the Land Development Code is amended
so that in no event shall the boundary of the critical water quality zone be less
than 200 feet from the centerline of a major waterway or be less than 400 feet from
the centerline of the main channel of Barton Creek. No pollution control structure,
or residential or commercial building, may be constructed in the critical water quality
zone in these watersheds.
